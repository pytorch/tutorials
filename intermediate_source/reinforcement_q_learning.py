Reinforcement Learning (DQN) Tutorial
=====================================
**Author**: `Adam Paszke <https://github.com/apaszke>`_
            `Mark Towers <https://github.com/pseudo-rnd-thoughts>`_


This tutorial shows how to use PyTorch to train a Deep Q Learning (DQN) agent
on the CartPole-v1 task from `Gymnasium <https://gymnasium.farama.org>`__.

**Task**

The agent has to decide between two actions - moving the cart left or
right - so that the pole attached to it stays upright. You can find more
information about the environment and other more challenging environments at
`Gymnasium's website <https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/>`__.

   CartPole

As the agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses
an action, the environment *transitions* to a new state, and also
returns a reward that indicates the consequences of the action. In this
task, rewards are +1 for every incremental timestep and the environment
terminates if the pole falls over too far or the cart moves more than 2.4
units away from center. This means better performing scenarios will run
for longer duration, accumulating larger return.

The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real
values representing the environment state (position, velocity, etc.).
We take these 4 inputs without any scaling and pass them through a 
small fully-connected network with 2 outputs, one for each action. 
The network is trained to predict the expected value for each action, 
given the input state. The action with the highest expected value is 
then chosen.


**Packages**


First, let's import needed packages. Firstly, we need
`gymnasium <https://gymnasium.farama.org/>`__ for the environment,
installed by using `pip`. This is a fork of the original OpenAI
Gym project and maintained by the same team since Gym v0.19.
If you are running this in Google Colab, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   %%bash
   pip3 install gymnasium[classic_control]

We'll also use the following from PyTorch:

-  neural networks (``torch.nn``)
-  optimization (``torch.optim``)
-  automatic differentiation (``torch.autograd``)

"""

import gymnasium as gym
import math
import random
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import namedtuple, deque
from itertools import count

import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# set up matplotlib
is_ipython = 'inline' in matplotlib.get_backend()
if is_ipython:
    from IPython import display

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")


######################################################################
# Replay Memory
# -------------
#
# We'll be using experience replay memory for training our DQN. It stores
# the transitions that the agent observes, allowing us to reuse this data
# later. By sampling from it randomly, the transitions that build up a
# batch are decorrelated. It has been shown that this greatly stabilizes
# and improves the DQN training procedure.
#
# For this, we're going to need two classes:
#
# -  ``Transition`` - a named tuple representing a single transition in
#    our environment. It essentially maps (state, action) pairs
#    to their (next_state, reward) result, with the state being the
#    screen difference image as described later on.
# -  ``ReplayMemory`` - a cyclic buffer of bounded size that holds the
#    transitions observed recently. It also implements a ``.sample()``
#    method for selecting a random batch of transitions for training.
#

Transition = namedtuple('Transition',
                        ('state', 'action', 'next_state', 'reward'))


class ReplayMemory(object):

    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.memory = deque([], maxlen=capacity)

    def push(self, *args):
        """Save a transition"""
        self.memory.append(Transition(*args))

    def sample(self, batch_size):
        return random.sample(self.memory, batch_size)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.memory)


######################################################################
# Now, let's define our model. But first, let's quickly recap what a DQN is.
#
# DQN algorithm
# -------------
#
# Our environment is deterministic, so all equations presented here are
# also formulated deterministically for the sake of simplicity. In the
# reinforcement learning literature, they would also contain expectations
# over stochastic transitions in the environment.
#
# Our aim will be to train a policy that tries to maximize the discounted,
# cumulative reward
# :math:`R_{t_0} = \sum_{t=t_0}^{\infty} \gamma^{t - t_0} r_t`, where
# :math:`R_{t_0}` is also known as the *return*. The discount,
# :math:`\gamma`, should be a constant between :math:`0` and :math:`1`
# that ensures the sum converges. A lower :math:`\gamma` makes 
# rewards from the uncertain far future less important for our agent 
# than the ones in the near future that it can be fairly confident 
# about. It also encourages agents to collect reward closer in time 
# than equivalent rewards that are temporally far away in the future.
#
# The main idea behind Q-learning is that if we had a function
# :math:`Q^*: State \times Action \rightarrow \mathbb{R}`, that could tell
# us what our return would be, if we were to take an action in a given
# state, then we could easily construct a policy that maximizes our
# rewards:
#
# .. math:: \pi^*(s) = \arg\!\max_a \ Q^*(s, a)
#
# However, we don't know everything about the world, so we don't have
# access to :math:`Q^*`. But, since neural networks are universal function
# approximators, we can simply create one and train it to resemble
# :math:`Q^*`.
#
# For our training update rule, we'll use a fact that every :math:`Q`
# function for some policy obeys the Bellman equation:
#
# .. math:: Q^{\pi}(s, a) = r + \gamma Q^{\pi}(s', \pi(s'))
#
# The difference between the two sides of the equality is known as the
# temporal difference error, :math:`\delta`:
#
# .. math:: \delta = Q(s, a) - (r + \gamma \max_a' Q(s', a))
#
# To minimize this error, we will use the `Huber
# loss <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss>`__. The Huber loss acts
# like the mean squared error when the error is small, but like the mean
# absolute error when the error is large - this makes it more robust to
# outliers when the estimates of :math:`Q` are very noisy. We calculate
# this over a batch of transitions, :math:`B`, sampled from the replay
# memory:
#
# .. math::
#
#    \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{|B|}\sum_{(s, a, s', r) \ \in \ B} \mathcal{L}(\delta)
#
# .. math::
#
#    \text{where} \quad \mathcal{L}(\delta) = \begin{cases}
#      \frac{1}{2}{\delta^2}  & \text{for } |\delta| \le 1, \\
#      |\delta| - \frac{1}{2} & \text{otherwise.}
#    \end{cases}
#
# Q-network
# ^^^^^^^^^
#
# Our model will be a feed forward  neural network that takes in the
# difference between the current and previous screen patches. It has two
# outputs, representing :math:`Q(s, \mathrm{left})` and
# :math:`Q(s, \mathrm{right})` (where :math:`s` is the input to the
# network). In effect, the network is trying to predict the *expected return* of
# taking each action given the current input.
#

#
# -  ``select_action`` - will select an action accordingly to an epsilon
#    greedy policy. Simply put, we'll sometimes use our model for choosing
#    the action, and sometimes we'll just sample one uniformly. The
#    probability of choosing a random action will start at ``EPS_START``
#    and will decay exponentially towards ``EPS_END``. ``EPS_DECAY``
#    controls the rate of the decay.
# -  ``plot_durations`` - a helper for plotting the duration of episodes,
#    along with an average over the last 100 episodes (the measure used in
#    the official evaluations). The plot will be underneath the cell
#    containing the main training loop, and will update after every
#    episode.

# GAMMA is the discount factor as mentioned in the previous section
# EPS_START is the starting value of epsilon

# Finally, the code for training our model.
#
# Here, you can find an ``optimize_model`` function that performs a
# single step of the optimization. It first samples a batch, concatenates
# all the tensors into a single one, computes :math:`Q(s_t, a_t)` and
# :math:`V(s_{t+1}) = \max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a)`, and combines them into our
# loss. By definition we set :math:`V(s) = 0` if :math:`s` is a terminal
# state. We also use a target network to compute :math:`V(s_{t+1})` for
# added stability. The target network is updated at every step with a 
# `soft update <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf>`__ controlled by 
# the hyperparameter ``TAU``, which was previously defined.

NLP from Scratch
================

In these three-part series you will build and train
a basic character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to classify words.

You will learn:

* How to construct Recurrent Neural Networks from scratch
* Essential data handling techniques for NLP
* How to train an RNN to identify the language origin of words.

Before you begin, we recommend that you review the following:

* `PyTorch Learn the Basics series <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html>`__
* `How to install PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`__

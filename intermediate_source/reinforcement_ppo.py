#
# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a policy-gradient algorithm where a
# batch of data is being collected and directly consumed to train the policy to maximise
# the expected return given some proximality constraints. You can think of it
# as a sophisticated version of `REINFORCE <https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00992696.pdf>`_,
# the foundational policy-optimization algorithm. For more information, see the
# `Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms <https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347>`_ paper.
#
# PPO is usually regarded as a fast and efficient method for online, on-policy
# reinforcement algorithm. TorchRL provides a loss-module that does all the work
# for you, so that you can rely on this implementation and focus on solving your
# problem rather than re-inventing the wheel every time you want to train a policy.
#
# For completeness, here is a brief overview of what the loss computes, even though
# this is taken care of by our :class:`~torchrl.objectives.ClipPPOLoss` moduleâ€”the algorithm works as follows:
# 1. we will sample a batch of data by playing the
# policy in the environment for a given number of steps.
# 2. Then, we will perform a given number of optimization steps with random sub-samples of this batch using
# a clipped version of the REINFORCE loss.
# 3. The clipping will put a pessimistic bound on our loss: lower return estimates will
# be favored compared to higher ones.
# The precise formula of the loss is:
#
# .. math::
#
#     L(s,a,\theta_k,\theta) = \min\left(
#     \frac{\pi_{\theta}(a|s)}{\pi_{\theta_k}(a|s)}  A^{\pi_{\theta_k}}(s,a), \;\;
#     g(\epsilon, A^{\pi_{\theta_k}}(s,a))
#     \right),
#
# There are two components in that loss: in the first part of the minimum operator,
# we simply compute an importance-weighted version of the REINFORCE loss (for example, a
# REINFORCE loss that we have corrected for the fact that the current policy
# configuration lags the one that was used for the data collection).
# The second part of that minimum operator is a similar loss where we have clipped
# the ratios when they exceeded or were below a given pair of thresholds.
#
# This loss ensures that whether the advantage is positive or negative, policy
# updates that would produce significant shifts from the previous configuration
# are being discouraged.
#
# This tutorial is structured as follows:
#
# 1. First, we will define a set of hyperparameters we will be using for training.
#
# 2. Next, we will focus on creating our environment, or simulator, using TorchRL's
#    wrappers and transforms.
#
# 3. Next, we will design the policy network and the value model,
#    which is indispensable to the loss function. These modules will be used
#    to configure our loss module.
#
# 4. Next, we will create the replay buffer and data loader.
#
# 5. Finally, we will run our training loop and analyze the results.
#
# Throughout this tutorial, we'll be using the :mod:`tensordict` library.
# :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict` is the lingua franca of TorchRL: it helps us abstract
# what a module reads and writes and care less about the specific data
# description and more about the algorithm itself.

# Define Hyperparameters
# ----------------------
#
# We set the hyperparameters for our algorithm. Depending on the resources
# available, one may choose to execute the policy on GPU or on another
# device.
# The ``frame_skip`` will control how for how many frames is a single
# action being executed. The rest of the arguments that count frames
# must be corrected for this value (since one environment step will
# actually return ``frame_skip`` frames).

######################################################################
# Data collection parameters
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# When collecting data, we will be able to choose how big each batch will be
# by defining a ``frames_per_batch`` parameter. We will also define how many
# frames (such as the number of interactions with the simulator) we will allow ourselves to
# use. In general, the goal of an RL algorithm is to learn to solve the task
# as fast as it can in terms of environment interactions: the lower the ``total_frames``
# the better.
#
frames_per_batch = 1000
# For a complete training, bring the number of frames up to 1M
total_frames = 50_000

######################################################################
# PPO parameters
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# At each data collection (or batch collection) we will run the optimization
# over a certain number of *epochs*, each time consuming the entire data we just
# acquired in a nested training loop. Here, the ``sub_batch_size`` is different from the
# ``frames_per_batch`` here above: recall that we are working with a "batch of data"
# coming from our collector, which size is defined by ``frames_per_batch``, and that
# we will further split in smaller sub-batches during the inner training loop.
# The size of these sub-batches is controlled by ``sub_batch_size``.
#

######################################################################
# Define an environment
# ---------------------
#
# In RL, an *environment* is usually the way we refer to a simulator or a
# control system. Various libraries provide simulation environments for reinforcement
# learning, including Gymnasium (previously OpenAI Gym), DeepMind control suite, and
# many others.
# As a general library, TorchRL's goal is to provide an interchangeable interface
# to a large panel of RL simulators, allowing you to easily swap one environment
# with another. For example, creating a wrapped gym environment can be achieved with few characters:
#

base_env = GymEnv("InvertedDoublePendulum-v4", device=device)

######################################################################
# There are a few things to notice in this code: first, we created
# the environment by calling the ``GymEnv`` wrapper. If extra keyword arguments
# are passed, they will be transmitted to the ``gym.make`` method, hence covering
# the most common environment construction commands.
# Alternatively, one could also directly create a gym environment using ``gym.make(env_name, **kwargs)``
# and wrap it in a `GymWrapper` class.
#
# Also the ``device`` argument: for gym, this only controls the device where
# input action and observed states will be stored, but the execution will always
# be done on CPU. The reason for this is simply that gym does not support on-device
# execution, unless specified otherwise. For other libraries, we have control over
# the execution device and, as much as we can, we try to stay consistent in terms of
# storing and execution backends.
#
# Transforms
# ~~~~~~~~~~
#
# We will append some transforms to our environments to prepare the data for
# the policy. In Gym, this is usually achieved via wrappers. TorchRL takes a different
# approach, more similar to other pytorch domain libraries, through the use of transforms.
# To add transforms to an environment, one should simply wrap it in a :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.TransformedEnv`
# instance and append the sequence of transforms to it. The transformed environment will inherit
# the device and meta-data of the wrapped environment, and transform these depending on the sequence
# of transforms it contains.
#
# Normalization
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The first to encode is a normalization transform.
# As a rule of thumbs, it is preferable to have data that loosely
# match a unit Gaussian distribution: to obtain this, we will
# run a certain number of random steps in the environment and compute
# the summary statistics of these observations.
#
# We'll append two other transforms: the :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.DoubleToFloat` transform will
# convert double entries to single-precision numbers, ready to be read by the
# policy. The :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.StepCounter` transform will be used to count the steps before
# the environment is terminated. We will use this measure as a supplementary measure
# of performance.
#
# As we will see later, many of the TorchRL's classes rely on :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict`
# to communicate. You could think of it as a python dictionary with some extra
# tensor features. In practice, this means that many modules we will be working
# with need to be told what key to read (``in_keys``) and what key to write
# (``out_keys``) in the ``tensordict`` they will receive. Usually, if ``out_keys``
# is omitted, it is assumed that the ``in_keys`` entries will be updated
# in-place. For our transforms, the only entry we are interested in is referred
# to as ``"observation"`` and our transform layers will be told to modify this
# entry and this entry only:
#

env = TransformedEnv(
    base_env,
    Compose(
        # normalize observations
        ObservationNorm(in_keys=["observation"]),
        DoubleToFloat(),
        StepCounter(),
    ),
)

######################################################################
# As you may have noticed, we have created a normalization layer but we did not
# set its normalization parameters. To do this, :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.ObservationNorm` can
# automatically gather the summary statistics of our environment:
#
env.transform[0].init_stats(num_iter=1000, reduce_dim=0, cat_dim=0)

######################################################################
# The :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.ObservationNorm` transform has now been populated with a
# location and a scale that will be used to normalize the data.
#
# Let us do a little sanity check for the shape of our summary stats:
#
print("normalization constant shape:", env.transform[0].loc.shape)

######################################################################
# An environment is not only defined by its simulator and transforms, but also
# by a series of metadata that describe what can be expected during its
# execution.
# For efficiency purposes, TorchRL is quite stringent when it comes to
# environment specs, but you can easily check that your environment specs are
# adequate.
# In our example, the :class:`~torchrl.envs.libs.gym.GymWrapper` and
# :class:`~torchrl.envs.libs.gym.GymEnv` that inherits
# from it already take care of setting the proper specs for your environment so
# you should not have to care about this.
#
# Nevertheless, let's see a concrete example using our transformed
# environment by looking at its specs.
# There are three specs to look at: ``observation_spec`` which defines what
# is to be expected when executing an action in the environment,
# ``reward_spec`` which indicates the reward domain and finally the
# ``input_spec`` (which contains the ``action_spec``) and which represents
# everything an environment requires to execute a single step.
#
print("observation_spec:", env.observation_spec)
print("reward_spec:", env.reward_spec)
print("input_spec:", env.input_spec)
print("action_spec (as defined by input_spec):", env.action_spec)

######################################################################
# the :func:`check_env_specs` function runs a small rollout and compares its output against the environment
# specs. If no error is raised, we can be confident that the specs are properly defined:
#
check_env_specs(env)

######################################################################
# For fun, let's see what a simple random rollout looks like. You can
# call `env.rollout(n_steps)` and get an overview of what the environment inputs
# and outputs look like. Actions will automatically be drawn from the action spec
# domain, so you don't need to care about designing a random sampler.
#
# Typically, at each step, an RL environment receives an
# action as input, and outputs an observation, a reward and a done state. The
# observation may be composite, meaning that it could be composed of more than one
# tensor. This is not a problem for TorchRL, since the whole set of observations
# is automatically packed in the output :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict`. After executing a rollout
# (for example, a sequence of environment steps and random action generations) over a given
# number of steps, we will retrieve a :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict` instance with a shape
# that matches this trajectory length:
#
rollout = env.rollout(3)
print("rollout of three steps:", rollout)
print("Shape of the rollout TensorDict:", rollout.batch_size)

######################################################################
# Our rollout data has a shape of ``torch.Size([3])``, which matches the number of steps
# we ran it for. The ``"next"`` entry points to the data coming after the current step.
# In most cases, the ``"next"`` data at time `t` matches the data at ``t+1``, but this
# may not be the case if we are using some specific transformations (for example, multi-step).
#
# Policy
# ------
#
# PPO utilizes a stochastic policy to handle exploration. This means that our
# neural network will have to output the parameters of a distribution, rather
# than a single value corresponding to the action taken.
#
# As the data is continuous, we use a Tanh-Normal distribution to respect the
# action space boundaries. TorchRL provides such distribution, and the only
# thing we need to care about is to build a neural network that outputs the
# right number of parameters for the policy to work with (a location, or mean,
# and a scale):
#
# .. math::
#
#     f_{\theta}(\text{observation}) = \mu_{\theta}(\text{observation}), \sigma^{+}_{\theta}(\text{observation})
#
# The only extra-difficulty that is brought up here is to split our output in two
# equal parts and map the second to a strictly positive space.
#
# We design the policy in three steps:
#
# 1. Define a neural network ``D_obs`` -> ``2 * D_action``. Indeed, our ``loc`` (mu) and ``scale`` (sigma) both have dimension ``D_action``.
#
# 2. Append a :class:`~tensordict.nn.distributions.NormalParamExtractor` to extract a location and a scale (for example, splits the input in two equal parts and applies a positive transformation to the scale parameter).
#
# 3. Create a probabilistic :class:`~tensordict.nn.TensorDictModule` that can generate this distribution and sample from it.
#

actor_net = nn.Sequential(
    nn.LazyLinear(num_cells, device=device),
    nn.Tanh(),
    nn.LazyLinear(num_cells, device=device),
    nn.Tanh(),
    nn.LazyLinear(num_cells, device=device),
    nn.Tanh(),
    nn.LazyLinear(2 * env.action_spec.shape[-1], device=device),
    NormalParamExtractor(),
)

######################################################################
# To enable the policy to "talk" with the environment through the ``tensordict``
# data carrier, we wrap the ``nn.Module`` in a :class:`~tensordict.nn.TensorDictModule`. This
# class will simply ready the ``in_keys`` it is provided with and write the
# outputs in-place at the registered ``out_keys``.
#
policy_module = TensorDictModule(
    actor_net, in_keys=["observation"], out_keys=["loc", "scale"]
)

######################################################################
# We now need to build a distribution out of the location and scale of our
# normal distribution. To do so, we instruct the
# :class:`~torchrl.modules.tensordict_module.ProbabilisticActor`
# class to build a :class:`~torchrl.modules.TanhNormal` out of the location and scale
# parameters. We also provide the minimum and maximum values of this
# distribution, which we gather from the environment specs.
#
# The name of the ``in_keys`` (and hence the name of the ``out_keys`` from
# the :class:`~tensordict.nn.TensorDictModule` above) cannot be set to any value one may
# like, as the :class:`~torchrl.modules.TanhNormal` distribution constructor will expect the
# ``loc`` and ``scale`` keyword arguments. That being said,
# :class:`~torchrl.modules.tensordict_module.ProbabilisticActor` also accepts
# ``Dict[str, str]`` typed ``in_keys`` where the key-value pair indicates
# what ``in_key`` string should be used for every keyword argument that is to be used.
#
policy_module = ProbabilisticActor(
    module=policy_module,
    spec=env.action_spec,
    in_keys=["loc", "scale"],
    distribution_class=TanhNormal,
    distribution_kwargs={
        "min": env.action_spec.space.low,
        "max": env.action_spec.space.high,
    },
    return_log_prob=True,
    # we'll need the log-prob for the numerator of the importance weights
)

######################################################################
# Value network
# -------------
#
# The value network is a crucial component of the PPO algorithm, even though it
# won't be used at inference time. This module will read the observations and
# return an estimation of the discounted return for the following trajectory.
# This allows us to amortize learning by relying on the some utility estimation
# that is learned on-the-fly during training. Our value network share the same
# structure as the policy, but for simplicity we assign it its own set of
# parameters.
#
value_net = nn.Sequential(
    nn.LazyLinear(num_cells, device=device),
    nn.Tanh(),
    nn.LazyLinear(num_cells, device=device),
    nn.Tanh(),
    nn.LazyLinear(num_cells, device=device),
    nn.Tanh(),
    nn.LazyLinear(1, device=device),
)

value_module = ValueOperator(
    module=value_net,
    in_keys=["observation"],
)

######################################################################
# let's try our policy and value modules. As we said earlier, the usage of
# :class:`~tensordict.nn.TensorDictModule` makes it possible to directly read the output
# of the environment to run these modules, as they know what information to read
# and where to write it:
#
print("Running policy:", policy_module(env.reset()))
print("Running value:", value_module(env.reset()))

######################################################################
# Data collector
# --------------
#
# TorchRL provides a set of `DataCollector classes <https://pytorch.org/rl/reference/collectors.html>`__.
# Briefly, these classes execute three operations: reset an environment,
# compute an action given the latest observation, execute a step in the environment,
# and repeat the last two steps until the environment signals a stop (or reaches
# a done state).
#
# They allow you to control how many frames to collect at each iteration
# (through the ``frames_per_batch`` parameter),
# when to reset the environment (through the ``max_frames_per_traj`` argument),
# on which ``device`` the policy should be executed, etc. They are also
# designed to work efficiently with batched and multiprocessed environments.
#
# The simplest data collector is the :class:`~torchrl.collectors.collectors.SyncDataCollector`:
# it is an iterator that you can use to get batches of data of a given length, and
# that will stop once a total number of frames (``total_frames``) have been
# collected.
# Other data collectors (:class:`~torchrl.collectors.collectors.MultiSyncDataCollector` and
# :class:`~torchrl.collectors.collectors.MultiaSyncDataCollector`) will execute
# the same operations in synchronous and asynchronous manner over a
# set of multiprocessed workers.
#
# As for the policy and environment before, the data collector will return
# :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict` instances with a total number of elements that will
# match ``frames_per_batch``. Using :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict` to pass data to the
# training loop allows you to write data loading pipelines
# that are 100% oblivious to the actual specificities of the rollout content.
#
collector = SyncDataCollector(
    env,
    policy_module,
    frames_per_batch=frames_per_batch,
    total_frames=total_frames,
    split_trajs=False,
    device=device,
)

######################################################################
# Replay buffer
# -------------
#
# Replay buffers are a common building piece of off-policy RL algorithms.
# In on-policy contexts, a replay buffer is refilled every time a batch of
# data is collected, and its data is repeatedly consumed for a certain number
# of epochs.
#
# TorchRL's replay buffers are built using a common container
# :class:`~torchrl.data.ReplayBuffer` which takes as argument the components
# of the buffer: a storage, a writer, a sampler and possibly some transforms.
# Only the storage (which indicates the replay buffer capacity) is mandatory.
# We also specify a sampler without repetition to avoid sampling multiple times
# the same item in one epoch.
# Using a replay buffer for PPO is not mandatory and we could simply
# sample the sub-batches from the collected batch, but using these classes
# make it easy for us to build the inner training loop in a reproducible way.
#

replay_buffer = ReplayBuffer(
    storage=LazyTensorStorage(max_size=frames_per_batch),
    sampler=SamplerWithoutReplacement(),
)

######################################################################
# Loss function
# -------------
#
# The PPO loss can be directly imported from TorchRL for convenience using the
# :class:`~torchrl.objectives.ClipPPOLoss` class. This is the easiest way of utilizing PPO:
# it hides away the mathematical operations of PPO and the control flow that
# goes with it.
#
# PPO requires some "advantage estimation" to be computed. In short, an advantage
# is a value that reflects an expectancy over the return value while dealing with
# the bias / variance tradeoff.
# To compute the advantage, one just needs to (1) build the advantage module, which
# utilizes our value operator, and (2) pass each batch of data through it before each
# epoch.
# The GAE module will update the input ``tensordict`` with new ``"advantage"`` and
# ``"value_target"`` entries.
# The ``"value_target"`` is a gradient-free tensor that represents the empirical
# value that the value network should represent with the input observation.
# Both of these will be used by :class:`~torchrl.objectives.ClipPPOLoss` to
# return the policy and value losses.
#

# Before the 1M step cap is reached, the algorithm should have reached a max
# step count of 1000 steps, which is the maximum number of steps before the

# Conclusion and next steps
# -------------------------
#
# In this tutorial, we have learned:
#
# 1. How to create and customize an environment with :py:mod:`torchrl`;
# 2. How to write a model and a loss function;
# 3. How to set up a typical training loop.
#
# If you want to experiment with this tutorial a bit more, you can apply the following modifications:
#
# * From an efficiency perspective,
#   we could run several simulations in parallel to speed up data collection.
#   Check :class:`~torchrl.envs.ParallelEnv` for further information.
#
# * From a logging perspective, one could add a :class:`torchrl.record.VideoRecorder` transform to
#   the environment after asking for rendering to get a visual rendering of the
#   inverted pendulum in action. Check :py:mod:`torchrl.record` to
#   know more.

# ``torch.compile`` is the new way to speed up your PyTorch code!
# ``torch.compile`` makes PyTorch code run faster by
# JIT-compiling PyTorch code into optimized kernels,
# while requiring minimal code changes.
#
# This tutorial covers an end-to-end example of training and evaluating a
# real model with ``torch.compile``. For a gentle introduction to ``torch.compile``,
# please check out `the introduction to torch.compile tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torch_compile_tutorial.html>`__.
#
# **Required pip Dependencies**
#
# - ``torch >= 2.0``
# - ``torchvision``

#        * How to apply ``torch.compile`` to a real model
#        * ``torch.compile`` speedups on a real model

# Let's demonstrate how using ``torch.compile`` can speed up a real model.

# ``torch.compile`` by evaluating and training a ``torchvision`` model on random data.

# Notice that ``torch.compile`` takes a lot longer to complete
# compared to eager. This is because ``torch.compile`` compiles
# the model into optimized kernels as it executes. In our example, the
# structure of the model doesn't change, and so recompilation is not
# needed. So if we run our optimized model several more times, we should
# see a significant improvement compared to eager.

######################################################################
# And indeed, we can see that running our model with ``torch.compile``
# results in a significant speedup. Speedup mainly comes from reducing Python overhead and
# GPU read/writes, and so the observed speedup may vary on factors such as model
# architecture and batch size. For example, if a model's architecture is simple
# and the amount of data is large, then the bottleneck would be
# GPU compute and the observed speedup may be less significant.
#
# You may also see different speedup results depending on the chosen ``mode``
# argument. The ``"reduce-overhead"`` mode uses CUDA graphs to further reduce
# the overhead of Python. For your own models,
# you may need to experiment with different modes to maximize speedup. You can
# read more about modes `here <https://pytorch.org/get-started/pytorch-2.0/#user-experience>`__.
#
# You may might also notice that the second time we run our model with ``torch.compile`` is significantly
# slower than the other runs, although it is much faster than the first run. This is because the ``"reduce-overhead"``
# mode runs a few warm-up iterations for CUDA graphs.
#
# Now, let's consider comparing training.

# Again, we can see that ``torch.compile`` takes longer in the first
# iteration, as it must compile the model, but in subsequent iterations, we see
# significant speedups compared to eager.
#
# We remark that the speedup numbers presented in this tutorial are for
# demonstration purposes only. Official speedup values can be seen at the
# `TorchInductor performance dashboard <https://hud.pytorch.org/benchmark/compilers>`__.

# Conclusion
# ------------
#
# In this tutorial, we applied ``torch.compile`` to training and inference on a real model,
# demonstrating speedups.
#
# Importantly, we note that the first few iterations of a compiled model
# are slower than eager mode due to compilation overhead, but subsequent iterations are expected to
# have speedups.

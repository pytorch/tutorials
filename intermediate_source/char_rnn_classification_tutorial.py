NLP From Scratch: Classifying Names with a Character-Level RNN
**************************************************************
**Author**: `Sean Robertson <https://github.com/spro>`_

This tutorials is part of a three-part series:

* `NLP From Scratch: Classifying Names with a Character-Level RNN <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html>`__
* `NLP From Scratch: Generating Names with a Character-Level RNN <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_generation_tutorial.html>`__
* `NLP From Scratch: Translation with a Sequence to Sequence Network and Attention <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html>`__

We will be building and training a basic character-level Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) to classify words. This tutorial, along with two other
Natural Language Processing (NLP) "from scratch" tutorials
:doc:`/intermediate/char_rnn_generation_tutorial` and
:doc:`/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial`, show how to
preprocess data to model NLP. In particular, these tutorials show how
preprocessing to model NLP works at a low level.

A character-level RNN reads words as a series of characters -
outputting a prediction and "hidden state" at each step, feeding its
previous hidden state into each next step. We take the final prediction
to be the output, i.e. which class the word belongs to.

Specifically, we'll train on a few thousand surnames from 18 languages
of origin, and predict which language a name is from based on the
spelling. 

Recommended Preparation
=======================

Before starting this tutorial it is recommended that you have installed PyTorch,
and have a basic understanding of Python programming language and Tensors:

-  https://pytorch.org/ For installation instructions
-  :doc:`/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz` to get started with PyTorch in general
   and learn the basics of Tensors
-  :doc:`/beginner/pytorch_with_examples` for a wide and deep overview
-  :doc:`/beginner/former_torchies_tutorial` if you are former Lua Torch user

It would also be useful to know about RNNs and how they work:

-  `The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural
   Networks <https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/>`__
   shows a bunch of real life examples
-  `Understanding LSTM
   Networks <https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/>`__
   is about LSTMs specifically but also informative about RNNs in
   general

# Preparing Torch 
# ==========================
#
# Set up torch to default to the right device use GPU acceleration depending on your hardware (CPU or CUDA). 
#

import torch 

# Check if CUDA is available
device = torch.device('cpu')
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device('cuda')

torch.set_default_device(device)
print(f"Using device = {torch.get_default_device()}")

######################################################################
# Preparing the Data
# ==================
#
# Download the data from `here <https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/data.zip>`__ 
# and extract it to the current directory.
#
# Included in the ``data/names`` directory are 18 text files named as
# ``[Language].txt``. Each file contains a bunch of names, one name per
# line, mostly romanized (but we still need to convert from Unicode to
# ASCII).
#
# The first step is to define and clean our data. Initially, we need to convert Unicode to plain ASCII to 
# limit the RNN input layers. This is accomplished by converting Unicode strings to ASCII and allowing only a small set of allowed characters. 

import string 
import unicodedata

allowed_characters = string.ascii_letters + " .,;'"
n_letters = len(allowed_characters) 

# Turn a Unicode string to plain ASCII, thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/a/518232/2809427    
def unicodeToAscii(s):
    return ''.join(
        c for c in unicodedata.normalize('NFD', s)
        if unicodedata.category(c) != 'Mn'
        and c in allowed_characters
    )

#########################
# Here's an example of converting a unicode alphabet name to plain ASCII. This simplifies the input layer
#

print (f"converting 'Ślusàrski' to {unicodeToAscii('Ślusàrski')}")

######################################################################
# Turning Names into Tensors
# ==========================
#
# Now that we have all the names organized, we need to turn them into
# Tensors to make any use of them.
#
# To represent a single letter, we use a "one-hot vector" of size
# ``<1 x n_letters>``. A one-hot vector is filled with 0s except for a 1
# at index of the current letter, e.g. ``"b" = <0 1 0 0 0 ...>``.
#
# To make a word we join a bunch of those into a 2D matrix
# ``<line_length x 1 x n_letters>``.
#
# That extra 1 dimension is because PyTorch assumes everything is in
# batches - we're just using a batch size of 1 here.

# Find letter index from all_letters, e.g. "a" = 0
def letterToIndex(letter):
    return allowed_characters.find(letter)

# Turn a line into a <line_length x 1 x n_letters>,
# or an array of one-hot letter vectors
def lineToTensor(line):
    tensor = torch.zeros(len(line), 1, n_letters)
    for li, letter in enumerate(line):
        tensor[li][0][letterToIndex(letter)] = 1
    return tensor

#########################
# Here are some examples of how to use ``lineToTensor()`` for a single and multiple character string.

print (f"The letter 'a' becomes {lineToTensor('a')}") #notice that the first position in the tensor = 1
print (f"The name 'Ahn' becomes {lineToTensor('Ahn')}") #notice 'A' sets the 27th index to 1

#########################
# Congratulations, you have built the foundational tensor objects for this learning task! You can use a similar approach 
# for other RNN tasks with text.
#
# Next, we need to combine all our examples into a dataset so we can train, test and validate our models. For this, 
# we will use the `Dataset and DataLoader <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/data_tutorial.html>`__ classes 
# to hold our dataset. Each Dataset needs to implement three functions: ``__init__``, ``__len__``, and ``__getitem__``.

#split the dataset into training and testing so we can validate the model that we build.

# Creating the Network
# ====================
#
# Before autograd, creating a recurrent neural network in Torch involved
# cloning the parameters of a layer over several timesteps. The layers
# held hidden state and gradients which are now entirely handled by the
# graph itself. This means you can implement a RNN in a very "pure" way,
# as regular feed-forward layers.
# 
# This CharRNN class implements an RNN with three components. 
# First, we use the `nn.RNN implementation <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.RNN.html>`__.
# Next, we define a layer that maps the RNN hidden layers to our output. And finally, we apply a ``softmax`` function. Using ``nn.RNN``
# leads to a significant improvement in performance, such as cuDNN-accelerated kernels, versus implementing 
# each layer as a ``nn.Linear``. It also simplifies the implementation in ``forward()``.
#

# Training the Network
# --------------------
#
# Now all it takes to train this network is show it a bunch of examples,
# have it make guesses, and tell it if it's wrong.
#
# We do this by defining a ``train()`` function which trains the model on a given dataset using minibatches. RNNs 
# RNNs are trained similarly to other networks; therefore, for completeness, we include a batched training method here.
# The loop (``for i in batch``) computes the losses for each of the items in the batch before adjusting the 
# weights. This operation is repeated until the number of epochs is reached.

# Exercises
# =========
#
# -  Get better results with a bigger and/or better shaped network
#
#    -  Adjust the hyperparameters to enhance performance, such as changing the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate
#    -  Try the ``nn.LSTM`` and ``nn.GRU`` layers
#    -  Modify the size of the layers, such as increasing or decreasing the number of hidden nodes or adding additional linear layers
#    -  Combine multiple of these RNNs as a higher level network
# 
# -  Try with a different dataset of line -> label, for example:
#
#    -  Any word -> language
#    -  First name -> gender
#    -  Character name -> writer
#    -  Page title -> blog or subreddit

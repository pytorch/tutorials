NLP From Scratch: Translation with a Sequence to Sequence Network and Attention
*******************************************************************************
**Author**: `Sean Robertson <https://github.com/spro>`_

This tutorials is part of a three-part series:

* `NLP From Scratch: Classifying Names with a Character-Level RNN <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html>`__
* `NLP From Scratch: Generating Names with a Character-Level RNN <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_generation_tutorial.html>`__
* `NLP From Scratch: Translation with a Sequence to Sequence Network and Attention <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html>`__

This is the third and final tutorial on doing **NLP From Scratch**, where we
write our own classes and functions to preprocess the data to do our NLP
modeling tasks.

In this project we will be teaching a neural network to translate from
French to English.

.. code-block:: sh

    [KEY: > input, = target, < output]

    > il est en train de peindre un tableau .
    = he is painting a picture .
    < he is painting a picture .

    > pourquoi ne pas essayer ce vin delicieux ?
    = why not try that delicious wine ?
    < why not try that delicious wine ?

    > elle n est pas poete mais romanciere .
    = she is not a poet but a novelist .
    < she not not a poet but a novelist .

    > vous etes trop maigre .
    = you re too skinny .
    < you re all alone .

... to varying degrees of success.

This is made possible by the simple but powerful idea of the `sequence
to sequence network <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__, in which two
recurrent neural networks work together to transform one sequence to
another. An encoder network condenses an input sequence into a vector,
and a decoder network unfolds that vector into a new sequence.

   :alt:

To improve upon this model we'll use an `attention
mechanism <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`__, which lets the decoder
learn to focus over a specific range of the input sequence.

**Recommended Reading:**

I assume you have at least installed PyTorch, know Python, and
understand Tensors:

-  https://pytorch.org/ For installation instructions
-  :doc:`/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz` to get started with PyTorch in general
-  :doc:`/beginner/pytorch_with_examples` for a wide and deep overview
-  :doc:`/beginner/former_torchies_tutorial` if you are former Lua Torch user


It would also be useful to know about Sequence to Sequence networks and
how they work:

-  `Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for
   Statistical Machine Translation <https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078>`__
-  `Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural
   Networks <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__
-  `Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and
   Translate <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`__
-  `A Neural Conversational Model <https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869>`__

You will also find the previous tutorials on
:doc:`/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial`
and :doc:`/intermediate/char_rnn_generation_tutorial`
helpful as those concepts are very similar to the Encoder and Decoder
models, respectively.

# The Seq2Seq Model
# =================
#
# A Recurrent Neural Network, or RNN, is a network that operates on a
# sequence and uses its own output as input for subsequent steps.
#
# A `Sequence to Sequence network <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__, or
# seq2seq network, or `Encoder Decoder
# network <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078v3.pdf>`__, is a model
# consisting of two RNNs called the encoder and decoder. The encoder reads
# an input sequence and outputs a single vector, and the decoder reads
# that vector to produce an output sequence.
#
# .. figure:: /_static/img/seq-seq-images/seq2seq.png
#    :alt:
#
# Unlike sequence prediction with a single RNN, where every input
# corresponds to an output, the seq2seq model frees us from sequence
# length and order, which makes it ideal for translation between two
# languages.
#
# Consider the sentence ``Je ne suis pas le chat noir`` → ``I am not the
# black cat``. Most of the words in the input sentence have a direct
# translation in the output sentence, but are in slightly different
# orders, e.g. ``chat noir`` and ``black cat``. Because of the ``ne/pas``
# construction there is also one more word in the input sentence. It would
# be difficult to produce a correct translation directly from the sequence
# of input words.
#
# With a seq2seq model the encoder creates a single vector which, in the
# ideal case, encodes the "meaning" of the input sequence into a single
# vector — a single point in some N dimensional space of sentences.
#


######################################################################
# The Encoder
# -----------
#
# The encoder of a seq2seq network is a RNN that outputs some value for
# every word from the input sentence. For every input word the encoder
# outputs a vector and a hidden state, and uses the hidden state for the
# next input word.

######################################################################
# The Decoder
# -----------
#
# The decoder is another RNN that takes the encoder output vector(s) and
# outputs a sequence of words to create the translation.
#


######################################################################
# Simple Decoder
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# In the simplest seq2seq decoder we use only last output of the encoder.
# This last output is sometimes called the *context vector* as it encodes
# context from the entire sequence. This context vector is used as the
# initial hidden state of the decoder.
#
# At every step of decoding, the decoder is given an input token and
# hidden state. The initial input token is the start-of-string ``<SOS>``
# token, and the first hidden state is the context vector (the encoder's
# last hidden state).

# I encourage you to train and observe the results of this model, but to
# save space we'll be going straight for the gold and introducing the
# Attention Mechanism.
#


######################################################################
# Attention Decoder
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# If only the context vector is passed between the encoder and decoder,
# that single vector carries the burden of encoding the entire sentence.
#
# Attention allows the decoder network to "focus" on a different part of
# the encoder's outputs for every step of the decoder's own outputs. First
# we calculate a set of *attention weights*. These will be multiplied by
# the encoder output vectors to create a weighted combination. The result
# (called ``attn_applied`` in the code) should contain information about
# that specific part of the input sequence, and thus help the decoder
# choose the right output words.
#
# .. figure:: https://i.imgur.com/1152PYf.png
#    :alt:
#
# Calculating the attention weights is done with another feed-forward
# layer ``attn``, using the decoder's input and hidden state as inputs.
# Because there are sentences of all sizes in the training data, to
# actually create and train this layer we have to choose a maximum
# sentence length (input length, for encoder outputs) that it can apply
# to. Sentences of the maximum length will use all the attention weights,
# while shorter sentences will only use the first few.
#

#
# Bahdanau attention, also known as additive attention, is a commonly used
# attention mechanism in sequence-to-sequence models, particularly in neural
# machine translation tasks. It was introduced by Bahdanau et al. in their
# paper titled `Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf>`__.
# This attention mechanism employs a learned alignment model to compute attention
# scores between the encoder and decoder hidden states. It utilizes a feed-forward
# neural network to calculate alignment scores.
#
# However, there are alternative attention mechanisms available, such as Luong attention,
# which computes attention scores by taking the dot product between the decoder hidden
# state and the encoder hidden states. It does not involve the non-linear transformation
# used in Bahdanau attention.
#
# In this tutorial, we will be using Bahdanau attention. However, it would be a valuable
# exercise to explore modifying the attention mechanism to use Luong attention.

# Training the Model
# ------------------
#
# To train we run the input sentence through the encoder, and keep track
# of every output and the latest hidden state. Then the decoder is given
# the ``<SOS>`` token as its first input, and the last hidden state of the
# encoder as its first hidden state.
#
# "Teacher forcing" is the concept of using the real target outputs as
# each next input, instead of using the decoder's guess as the next input.
# Using teacher forcing causes it to converge faster but `when the trained
# network is exploited, it may exhibit
# instability <http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.378.4095&rep=rep1&type=pdf>`__.
#
# You can observe outputs of teacher-forced networks that read with
# coherent grammar but wander far from the correct translation -
# intuitively it has learned to represent the output grammar and can "pick
# up" the meaning once the teacher tells it the first few words, but it
# has not properly learned how to create the sentence from the translation
# in the first place.
#
# Because of the freedom PyTorch's autograd gives us, we can randomly
# choose to use teacher forcing or not with a simple if statement. Turn
# ``teacher_forcing_ratio`` up to use more of it.

# Evaluation
# ==========

# Evaluation is mostly the same as training, but there are no targets so
# we simply feed the decoder's predictions back to itself for each step.
# Every time it predicts a word we add it to the output string, and if it
# predicts the EOS token we stop there. We also store the decoder's
# attention outputs for display later.

# Training and Evaluating
# =======================
#
# With all these helper functions in place (it looks like extra work, but
# it makes it easier to run multiple experiments) we can actually
# initialize a network and start training.
#
# Remember that the input sentences were heavily filtered. For this small
# dataset we can use relatively small networks of 256 hidden nodes and a
# single GRU layer. After about 40 minutes on a MacBook CPU we'll get some
# reasonable results.
#
# .. note::
#    If you run this notebook you can train, interrupt the kernel,
#    evaluate, and continue training later. Comment out the lines where the
#    encoder and decoder are initialized and run ``trainIters`` again.

# Visualizing Attention
# ---------------------
#
# A useful property of the attention mechanism is its highly interpretable
# outputs. Because it is used to weight specific encoder outputs of the
# input sequence, we can imagine looking where the network is focused most
# at each time step.
#
# You could simply run ``plt.matshow(attentions)`` to see attention output
# displayed as a matrix. For a better viewing experience we will do the
# extra work of adding axes and labels:
#

# Exercises
# =========
#
# -  Try with a different dataset
#
#    -  Another language pair
#    -  Human → Machine (e.g. IOT commands)
#    -  Chat → Response
#    -  Question → Answer
#
# -  Replace the embeddings with pretrained word embeddings such as ``word2vec`` or
#    ``GloVe``
# -  Try with more layers, more hidden units, and more sentences. Compare
#    the training time and results.
# -  If you use a translation file where pairs have two of the same phrase
#    (``I am test \t I am test``), you can use this as an autoencoder. Try
#    this:
#
#    -  Train as an autoencoder
#    -  Save only the Encoder network
#    -  Train a new Decoder for translation from there
#

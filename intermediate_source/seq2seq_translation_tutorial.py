NLP From Scratch: Translation with a Sequence to Sequence Network and Attention
*******************************************************************************
**Author**: `Sean Robertson <https://github.com/spro>`_

This is the third and final tutorial on doing "NLP From Scratch", where we
write our own classes and functions to preprocess the data to do our NLP
modeling tasks. We hope after you complete this tutorial that you'll proceed to
learn how `torchtext` can handle much of this preprocessing for you in the
three tutorials immediately following this one.

In this project we will be teaching a neural network to translate from
French to English.

.. code-block:: sh

    [KEY: > input, = target, < output]

    > il est en train de peindre un tableau .
    = he is painting a picture .
    < he is painting a picture .

    > pourquoi ne pas essayer ce vin delicieux ?
    = why not try that delicious wine ?
    < why not try that delicious wine ?

    > elle n est pas poete mais romanciere .
    = she is not a poet but a novelist .
    < she not not a poet but a novelist .

    > vous etes trop maigre .
    = you re too skinny .
    < you re all alone .

... to varying degrees of success.

This is made possible by the simple but powerful idea of the `sequence
to sequence network <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__, in which two
recurrent neural networks work together to transform one sequence to
another. An encoder network condenses an input sequence into a vector,
and a decoder network unfolds that vector into a new sequence.

   :alt:

To improve upon this model we'll use an `attention
mechanism <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`__, which lets the decoder
learn to focus over a specific range of the input sequence.

**Recommended Reading:**

I assume you have at least installed PyTorch, know Python, and
understand Tensors:

-  https://pytorch.org/ For installation instructions
-  :doc:`/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz` to get started with PyTorch in general
-  :doc:`/beginner/pytorch_with_examples` for a wide and deep overview
-  :doc:`/beginner/former_torchies_tutorial` if you are former Lua Torch user


It would also be useful to know about Sequence to Sequence networks and
how they work:

-  `Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for
   Statistical Machine Translation <https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078>`__
-  `Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural
   Networks <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__
-  `Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and
   Translate <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`__
-  `A Neural Conversational Model <https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869>`__

You will also find the previous tutorials on
:doc:`/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial`
and :doc:`/intermediate/char_rnn_generation_tutorial`
helpful as those concepts are very similar to the Encoder and Decoder
models, respectively.

# The Seq2Seq Model
# =================
#
# A Recurrent Neural Network, or RNN, is a network that operates on a
# sequence and uses its own output as input for subsequent steps.
#
# A `Sequence to Sequence network <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__, or
# seq2seq network, or `Encoder Decoder
# network <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078v3.pdf>`__, is a model
# consisting of two RNNs called the encoder and decoder. The encoder reads
# an input sequence and outputs a single vector, and the decoder reads
# that vector to produce an output sequence.
#
# .. figure:: /_static/img/seq-seq-images/seq2seq.png
#    :alt:
#
# Unlike sequence prediction with a single RNN, where every input
# corresponds to an output, the seq2seq model frees us from sequence
# length and order, which makes it ideal for translation between two
# languages.
#
# Consider the sentence ``Je ne suis pas le chat noir`` → ``I am not the
# black cat``. Most of the words in the input sentence have a direct
# translation in the output sentence, but are in slightly different
# orders, e.g. ``chat noir`` and ``black cat``. Because of the ``ne/pas``
# construction there is also one more word in the input sentence. It would
# be difficult to produce a correct translation directly from the sequence
# of input words.
#
# With a seq2seq model the encoder creates a single vector which, in the
# ideal case, encodes the "meaning" of the input sequence into a single
# vector — a single point in some N dimensional space of sentences.
#


######################################################################
# The Encoder
# -----------
#
# The encoder of a seq2seq network is a RNN that outputs some value for
# every word from the input sentence. For every input word the encoder
# outputs a vector and a hidden state, and uses the hidden state for the
# next input word.

# The Decoder
# -----------
#
# The decoder is another RNN that takes the encoder output vector(s) and
# outputs a sequence of words to create the translation.
#


######################################################################
# Simple Decoder
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# In the simplest seq2seq decoder we use only last output of the encoder.
# This last output is sometimes called the *context vector* as it encodes
# context from the entire sequence. This context vector is used as the
# initial hidden state of the decoder.
#
# At every step of decoding, the decoder is given an input token and
# hidden state. The initial input token is the start-of-string ``<SOS>``
# token, and the first hidden state is the context vector (the encoder's
# last hidden state).

# I encourage you to train and observe the results of this model, but to
# save space we'll be going straight for the gold and introducing the
# Attention Mechanism.
#


######################################################################
# Attention Decoder
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# If only the context vector is passed between the encoder and decoder,
# that single vector carries the burden of encoding the entire sentence.
#
# Attention allows the decoder network to "focus" on a different part of
# the encoder's outputs for every step of the decoder's own outputs. First
# we calculate a set of *attention weights*. These will be multiplied by
# the encoder output vectors to create a weighted combination. The result
# (called ``attn_applied`` in the code) should contain information about
# that specific part of the input sequence, and thus help the decoder
# choose the right output words.
#
# .. figure:: https://i.imgur.com/1152PYf.png
#    :alt:
#
# Calculating the attention weights is done with another feed-forward
# layer ``attn``, using the decoder's input and hidden state as inputs.
# Because there are sentences of all sizes in the training data, to
# actually create and train this layer we have to choose a maximum
# sentence length (input length, for encoder outputs) that it can apply
# to. Sentences of the maximum length will use all the attention weights,
# while shorter sentences will only use the first few.
#

#
# Bahdanau attention, also known as additive attention, is a commonly used
# attention mechanism in sequence-to-sequence models, particularly in neural
# machine translation tasks. It was introduced by Bahdanau et al. in their
# paper titled `Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf>`__.
# This attention mechanism employs a learned alignment model to compute attention
# scores between the encoder and decoder hidden states. It utilizes a feed-forward
# neural network to calculate alignment scores.
#
# However, there are alternative attention mechanisms available, such as Luong attention,
# which computes attention scores by taking the dot product between the decoder hidden
# state and the encoder hidden states. It does not involve the non-linear transformation
# used in Bahdanau attention.
#
# In this tutorial, we will be using Bahdanau attention. However, it would be a valuable
# exercise to explore modifying the attention mechanism to use Luong attention.

# Training the Model
# ------------------
#
# To train we run the input sentence through the encoder, and keep track
# of every output and the latest hidden state. Then the decoder is given
# the ``<SOS>`` token as its first input, and the last hidden state of the
# encoder as its first hidden state.
#
# "Teacher forcing" is the concept of using the real target outputs as
# each next input, instead of using the decoder's guess as the next input.
# Using teacher forcing causes it to converge faster but `when the trained
# network is exploited, it may exhibit
# instability <http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.378.4095&rep=rep1&type=pdf>`__.
#
# You can observe outputs of teacher-forced networks that read with
# coherent grammar but wander far from the correct translation -
# intuitively it has learned to represent the output grammar and can "pick
# up" the meaning once the teacher tells it the first few words, but it
# has not properly learned how to create the sentence from the translation
# in the first place.
#
# Because of the freedom PyTorch's autograd gives us, we can randomly
# choose to use teacher forcing or not with a simple if statement. Turn
# ``teacher_forcing_ratio`` up to use more of it.

# Evaluation
# ==========

# Evaluation is mostly the same as training, but there are no targets so
# we simply feed the decoder's predictions back to itself for each step.
# Every time it predicts a word we add it to the output string, and if it
# predicts the EOS token we stop there. We also store the decoder's
# attention outputs for display later.

# Training and Evaluating
# =======================
#
# With all these helper functions in place (it looks like extra work, but
# it makes it easier to run multiple experiments) we can actually
# initialize a network and start training.
#
# Remember that the input sentences were heavily filtered. For this small
# dataset we can use relatively small networks of 256 hidden nodes and a
# single GRU layer. After about 40 minutes on a MacBook CPU we'll get some
# reasonable results.
#
# .. note::
#    If you run this notebook you can train, interrupt the kernel,
#    evaluate, and continue training later. Comment out the lines where the
#    encoder and decoder are initialized and run ``trainIters`` again.

# Visualizing Attention
# ---------------------
#
# A useful property of the attention mechanism is its highly interpretable
# outputs. Because it is used to weight specific encoder outputs of the
# input sequence, we can imagine looking where the network is focused most
# at each time step.
#
# You could simply run ``plt.matshow(attentions)`` to see attention output
# displayed as a matrix. For a better viewing experience we will do the
# extra work of adding axes and labels:
#

                       ['<EOS>'], rotation=90)
    ax.set_yticklabels([''] + output_words)

    # Show label at every tick

    showAttention(input_sentence, output_words, attentions[0, :len(output_words), :])

# Exercises
# =========
#
# -  Try with a different dataset
#
#    -  Another language pair
#    -  Human → Machine (e.g. IOT commands)
#    -  Chat → Response
#    -  Question → Answer
#
# -  Replace the embeddings with pretrained word embeddings such as ``word2vec`` or
#    ``GloVe``
# -  Try with more layers, more hidden units, and more sentences. Compare
#    the training time and results.
# -  If you use a translation file where pairs have two of the same phrase
#    (``I am test \t I am test``), you can use this as an autoencoder. Try
#    this:
#
#    -  Train as an autoencoder
#    -  Save only the Encoder network
#    -  Train a new Decoder for translation from there
#

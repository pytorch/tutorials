Translation with a Sequence to Sequence Network and Attention
*************************************************************
**Author**: `Sean Robertson <https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch>`_

In this project we will be teaching a neural network to translate from
French to English.

::

    [KEY: > input, = target, < output]

    > il est en train de peindre un tableau .
    = he is painting a picture .
    < he is painting a picture .

    > pourquoi ne pas essayer ce vin delicieux ?
    = why not try that delicious wine ?
    < why not try that delicious wine ?

    > elle n est pas poete mais romanciere .
    = she is not a poet but a novelist .
    < she not not a poet but a novelist .

    > vous etes trop maigre .
    = you re too skinny .
    < you re all alone .

... to varying degrees of success.

This is made possible by the simple but powerful idea of the `sequence
to sequence network <http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__, in which two
recurrent neural networks work together to transform one sequence to
another. An encoder network condenses an input sequence into a vector,
and a decoder network unfolds that vector into a new sequence.

To improve upon this model we'll use an `attention
mechanism <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`__, which lets the decoder
learn to focus over a specific range of the input sequence.

**Recommended Reading:**

I assume you have at least installed PyTorch, know Python, and
understand Tensors:

-  http://pytorch.org/ For installation instructions
-  :doc:`/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz` to get started with PyTorch in general
-  :doc:`/beginner/pytorch_with_examples` for a wide and deep overview
-  :doc:`/beginner/former_torchies_tutorial` if you are former Lua Torch user


It would also be useful to know about Sequence to Sequence networks and
how they work:

-  `Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for
   Statistical Machine Translation <http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078>`__
-  `Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural
   Networks <http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__
-  `Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and
   Translate <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`__
-  `A Neural Conversational Model <http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869>`__

You will also find the previous tutorials on
:doc:`/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial`
and :doc:`/intermediate/char_rnn_generation_tutorial`
helpful as those concepts are very similar to the Encoder and Decoder
models, respectively.

And for more, read the papers that introduced these topics:

-  `Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for
   Statistical Machine Translation <http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078>`__

   Networks <http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__

# The data for this project is a set of many thousands of English to
# French translation pairs.
#
# `This question on Open Data Stack
# Exchange <http://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/3888/dataset-of-sentences-translated-into-many-languages>`__
# pointed me to the open translation site http://tatoeba.org/ which has
# downloads available at http://tatoeba.org/eng/downloads - and better
# yet, someone did the extra work of splitting language pairs into
# individual text files here: http://www.manythings.org/anki/
#
# The English to French pairs are too big to include in the repo, so
# download to ``data/eng-fra.txt`` before continuing. The file is a tab
# separated list of translation pairs:

# Similar to the character encoding used in the character-level RNN

# language, there are many many more words, so the encoding vector is much
# larger. We will however cheat a bit and trim the data to only use a few

# The Seq2Seq Model
# =================
#
# A Recurrent Neural Network, or RNN, is a network that operates on a
# sequence and uses its own output as input for subsequent steps.
#
# A `Sequence to Sequence network <http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__, or
# seq2seq network, or `Encoder Decoder
# network <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078v3.pdf>`__, is a model
# consisting of two RNNs called the encoder and decoder. The encoder reads
# an input sequence and outputs a single vector, and the decoder reads
# that vector to produce an output sequence.
#
# .. figure:: /_static/img/seq-seq-images/seq2seq.png
#    :alt:
#
# Unlike sequence prediction with a single RNN, where every input
# corresponds to an output, the seq2seq model frees us from sequence
# length and order, which makes it ideal for translation between two
# languages.
#
# Consider the sentence "Je ne suis pas le chat noir" → "I am not the
# black cat". Most of the words in the input sentence have a direct
# translation in the output sentence, but are in slightly different
# orders, e.g. "chat noir" and "black cat". Because of the "ne/pas"
# construction there is also one more word in the input sentence. It would
# be difficult to produce a correct translation directly from the sequence
# of input words.
#
# With a seq2seq model the encoder creates a single vector which, in the
# ideal case, encodes the "meaning" of the input sequence into a single
# vector — a single point in some N dimensional space of sentences.
#


######################################################################
# The Encoder
# -----------
#
# The encoder of a seq2seq network is a RNN that outputs some value for
# every word from the input sentence. For every input word the encoder
# outputs a vector and a hidden state, and uses the hidden state for the
# next input word.

######################################################################
# The Decoder
# -----------
#
# The decoder is another RNN that takes the encoder output vector(s) and
# outputs a sequence of words to create the translation.
#


######################################################################
# Simple Decoder
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# In the simplest seq2seq decoder we use only last output of the encoder.
# This last output is sometimes called the *context vector* as it encodes
# context from the entire sequence. This context vector is used as the
# initial hidden state of the decoder.
#
# At every step of decoding, the decoder is given an input token and
# hidden state. The initial input token is the start-of-string ``<SOS>``
# token, and the first hidden state is the context vector (the encoder's
# last hidden state).
#
# .. figure:: /_static/img/seq-seq-images/decoder-network.png
#    :alt:

class DecoderRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(DecoderRNN, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size

# I encourage you to train and observe the results of this model, but to
# save space we'll be going straight for the gold and introducing the
# Attention Mechanism.
#


######################################################################
# Attention Decoder
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# If only the context vector is passed betweeen the encoder and decoder,
# that single vector carries the burden of encoding the entire sentence.
#
# Attention allows the decoder network to "focus" on a different part of
# the encoder's outputs for every step of the decoder's own outputs. First
# we calculate a set of *attention weights*. These will be multiplied by
# the encoder output vectors to create a weighted combination. The result
# (called ``attn_applied`` in the code) should contain information about
# that specific part of the input sequence, and thus help the decoder
# choose the right output words.
#
# .. figure:: https://i.imgur.com/1152PYf.png
#    :alt:
#
# Calculating the attention weights is done with another feed-forward
# layer ``attn``, using the decoder's input and hidden state as inputs.
# Because there are sentences of all sizes in the training data, to
# actually create and train this layer we have to choose a maximum
# sentence length (input length, for encoder outputs) that it can apply
# to. Sentences of the maximum length will use all the attention weights,
# while shorter sentences will only use the first few.

######################################################################
# Training the Model
# ------------------
#
# To train we run the input sentence through the encoder, and keep track
# of every output and the latest hidden state. Then the decoder is given
# the ``<SOS>`` token as its first input, and the last hidden state of the
# encoder as its first hidden state.
#
# "Teacher forcing" is the concept of using the real target outputs as
# each next input, instead of using the decoder's guess as the next input.
# Using teacher forcing causes it to converge faster but `when the trained
# network is exploited, it may exhibit
# instability <http://minds.jacobs-university.de/sites/default/files/uploads/papers/ESNTutorialRev.pdf>`__.
#
# You can observe outputs of teacher-forced networks that read with
# coherent grammar but wander far from the correct translation -
# intuitively it has learned to represent the output grammar and can "pick
# up" the meaning once the teacher tells it the first few words, but it
# has not properly learned how to create the sentence from the translation
# in the first place.
#
# Because of the freedom PyTorch's autograd gives us, we can randomly
# choose to use teacher forcing or not with a simple if statement. Turn
# ``teacher_forcing_ratio`` up to use more of it.

#
# Evaluation is mostly the same as training, but there are no targets so
# we simply feed the decoder's predictions back to itself for each step.
# Every time it predicts a word we add it to the output string, and if it
# predicts the EOS token we stop there. We also store the decoder's
# attention outputs for display later.

# Training and Evaluating
# =======================
#
# With all these helper functions in place (it looks like extra work, but
# it makes it easier to run multiple experiments) we can actually
# initialize a network and start training.
#
# Remember that the input sentences were heavily filtered. For this small
# dataset we can use relatively small networks of 256 hidden nodes and a
# single GRU layer. After about 40 minutes on a MacBook CPU we'll get some
# reasonable results.
#
# .. Note::
#    If you run this notebook you can train, interrupt the kernel,
#    evaluate, and continue training later. Comment out the lines where the
#    encoder and decoder are initialized and run ``trainIters`` again.
#

hidden_size = 256
encoder1 = EncoderRNN(input_lang.n_words, hidden_size).to(device)
attn_decoder1 = AttnDecoderRNN(hidden_size, output_lang.n_words, dropout_p=0.1).to(device)

trainIters(encoder1, attn_decoder1, 75000, print_every=5000)

# Visualizing Attention
# ---------------------
#
# A useful property of the attention mechanism is its highly interpretable
# outputs. Because it is used to weight specific encoder outputs of the
# input sequence, we can imagine looking where the network is focused most
# at each time step.
#
# You could simply run ``plt.matshow(attentions)`` to see attention output
# displayed as a matrix, with the columns being input steps and rows being
# output steps:
#

output_words, attentions = evaluate(
    encoder1, attn_decoder1, "je suis trop froid .")
plt.matshow(attentions.numpy())


######################################################################
# For a better viewing experience we will do the extra work of adding axes
# and labels:
#

def showAttention(input_sentence, output_words, attentions):
    # Set up figure with colorbar
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
    cax = ax.matshow(attentions.numpy(), cmap='bone')
    fig.colorbar(cax)

    # Set up axes
    ax.set_xticklabels([''] + input_sentence.split(' ') +
                       ['<EOS>'], rotation=90)
    ax.set_yticklabels([''] + output_words)

    # Show label at every tick
    ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(ticker.MultipleLocator(1))
    ax.yaxis.set_major_locator(ticker.MultipleLocator(1))

    plt.show()


def evaluateAndShowAttention(input_sentence):
    output_words, attentions = evaluate(
        encoder1, attn_decoder1, input_sentence)
    print('input =', input_sentence)
    print('output =', ' '.join(output_words))
    showAttention(input_sentence, output_words, attentions)


evaluateAndShowAttention("elle a cinq ans de moins que moi .")

evaluateAndShowAttention("elle est trop petit .")

evaluateAndShowAttention("je ne crains pas de mourir .")

evaluateAndShowAttention("c est un jeune directeur plein de talent .")

# Exercises
# =========
#
# -  Try with a different dataset
#
#    -  Another language pair
#    -  Human → Machine (e.g. IOT commands)
#    -  Chat → Response
#    -  Question → Answer
#
# -  Replace the embeddings with pre-trained word embeddings such as word2vec or
#    GloVe
# -  Try with more layers, more hidden units, and more sentences. Compare
#    the training time and results.
# -  If you use a translation file where pairs have two of the same phrase
#    (``I am test \t I am test``), you can use this as an autoencoder. Try
#    this:
#
#    -  Train as an autoencoder
#    -  Save only the Encoder network
#    -  Train a new Decoder for translation from there
#

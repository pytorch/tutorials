# Embeddings
# ~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# When building recommendation systems, categorical features typically
# have massive cardinality, posts, users, ads, and so on.
# 
# In order to represent these entities and model these relationships,
# **embeddings** are used. In machine learning, **embeddings are a vectors
# of real numbers in a high-dimensional space used to represent meaning in
# complex data like words, images, or users**.
# 
# Embeddings in RecSys
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# Now you might wonder, how are these embeddings generated in the first
# place? Well, embeddings are represented as individual rows in an
# **Embedding Table**, also referred to as embedding weights. The reason
# for this is that embeddings or embedding table weights are trained just
# like all of the other weights of the model via gradient descent!
# 
# Embedding tables are simply a large matrix for storing embeddings, with
# two dimensions (B, N), where:
# 
# * B is the number of embeddings stored by the table
# * N is the number of dimensions per embedding (N-dimensional embedding).
# 
# The inputs to embedding tables represent embedding lookups to retrieve
# the embedding for a specific index or row. In recommendation systems, such
# as those used in many large systems, unique IDs are not only used for
# specific users, but also across entities like posts and ads to serve as
# lookup indices to respective embedding tables!
# 
# Embeddings are trained in RecSys through the following process:
#
# * **Input/lookup indices are fed into the model, as unique IDs**. IDs are
#   hashed to the total size of the embedding table to prevent issues when
#   the ID > number of rows
# 
# * Embeddings are then retrieved and **pooled, such as taking the sum or 
#   mean of the embeddings**. This is required as there can be a variable number of
#   embeddings per example while the model expects consistent shapes.
#
# * The **embeddings are used in conjunction with the rest of the model to
#   produce a prediction**, such as `Click-Through Rate
#   (CTR) <https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2615875?hl=en>`__
#   for an ad.
#
# * The loss is calculated with the prediction and the label
#   for an example, and **all weights of the model are updated through
#   gradient descent and backpropagation, including the embedding weights**
#   that were associated with the example.
# 
# These embeddings are crucial for representing categorical features, such
# as users, posts, and ads, in order to capture relationships and make
# good recommendations. The `Deep learning recommendation
# model <https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00091>`__ (DLRM) paper talks more
# about the technical details of using embedding tables in RecSys.
# 
# This tutorial introduces the concept of embeddings, showcase
# TorchRec specific modules and data types, and depict how distributed training
# works with TorchRec.

# Embeddings in PyTorch
# ---------------------
# 
# In PyTorch, we have the following types of embeddings:  
#
# * :class:`torch.nn.Embedding`: An embedding table where forward pass returns the
#   embeddings themselves as is.
# 
# * :class:`torch.nn.EmbeddingBag`: Embedding table where forward pass returns
#   embeddings that are then pooled, for example, sum or mean, otherwise known
#   as **Pooled Embeddings**.
# 
# In this section, we will go over a very brief introduction to performing
# embedding lookups by passing in indices into the table. 
# 

num_embeddings, embedding_dim = 10, 4

# Initialize our embedding table
weights = torch.rand(num_embeddings, embedding_dim)
print("Weights:", weights)

# Pass in pre-generated weights just for example, typically weights are randomly initialized
embedding_collection = torch.nn.Embedding(
    num_embeddings, embedding_dim, _weight=weights
)
embedding_bag_collection = torch.nn.EmbeddingBag(
    num_embeddings, embedding_dim, _weight=weights
)

# Print out the tables, we should see the same weights as above
print("Embedding Collection Table: ", embedding_collection.weight)
print("Embedding Bag Collection Table: ", embedding_bag_collection.weight)

# Lookup rows (ids for embedding ids) from the embedding tables
# 2D tensor with shape (batch_size, ids for each batch)
ids = torch.tensor([[1, 3]])
print("Input row IDS: ", ids)

embeddings = embedding_collection(ids)

# Print out the embedding lookups
# You should see the specific embeddings be the same as the rows (ids) of the embedding tables above
print("Embedding Collection Results: ")
print(embeddings)
print("Shape: ", embeddings.shape)

# ``nn.EmbeddingBag`` default pooling is mean, so should be mean of batch dimension of values above
pooled_embeddings = embedding_bag_collection(ids)

print("Embedding Bag Collection Results: ")
print(pooled_embeddings)
print("Shape: ", pooled_embeddings.shape)

# ``nn.EmbeddingBag`` is the same as ``nn.Embedding`` but just with pooling (mean, sum, and so on)
# We can see that the mean of the embeddings of embedding_collection is the same as the output of the embedding_bag_collection
print("Mean: ", torch.mean(embedding_collection(ids), dim=1))

# Congratulations! Now you have a basic understanding of how to use

# TorchRec Features Overview
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# 
# In the section above we've learned how to use embedding tables, one of the foundations of
# modern recommendation systems! These tables represent entities and
# relationships, such as users, pages, posts, etc. Given that these
# entities are always increasing, a **hash** function is typically applied
# to make sure the IDs are within the bounds of a certain embedding table.
# However, in order to represent a vast amount of entities and reduce hash
# collisions, these tables can become quite massive (think about the number of ads
# for example). In fact, these tables can become so massive that they
# won't be able to fit on 1 GPU, even with 80G of memory.
# 
# In order to train models with massive embedding tables, sharding these
# tables across GPUs is required, which then introduces a whole new set of
# problems and opportunities in parallelism and optimization. Luckily, we have
# the TorchRec library that has encountered, consolidated, and addressed
# many of these concerns. TorchRec serves as a **library that provides
# primitives for large scale distributed embeddings**.
# 
# Next, we will explore the major features of the TorchRec
# library. We will start with ``torch.nn.Embedding`` and will extend that to
# custom TorchRec modules, explore distributed training environment with
# generating a sharding plan for embeddings, look at inherent TorchRec
# optimizations, and extend the model to be ready for inference in C++.
# Below is a quick outline of what this section consists of:
# 
# * TorchRec Modules and Data Types
# * Distributed Training, Sharding, and Optimizations
# * Inference
# 
# Let's begin with importing TorchRec: 

import torchrec


######################################################################
# TorchRec Modules and Data Types
# ----------------------------------
# 
# This section goes over TorchRec Modules and data types including such
# entities as ``EmbeddingCollection`` and ``EmbeddingBagCollection``,
# ``JaggedTensor``, ``KeyedJaggedTensor``, ``KeyedTensor`` and more.
#
# From ``EmbeddingBag`` to ``EmbeddingBagCollection``
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# We have already explored :class:`torch.nn.Embedding` and :class:`torch.nn.EmbeddingBag`.
# TorchRec extends these modules by creating collections of embeddings, in
# other words modules that can have multiple embedding tables, with
# ``EmbeddingCollection`` and ``EmbeddingBagCollection``
# We will use ``EmbeddingBagCollection`` to represent a group of
# embedding bags.
# 
# In the example code below, we create an ``EmbeddingBagCollection`` (EBC)
# with two embedding bags, 1 representing **products** and 1 representing **users**. 
# Each table, ``product_table`` and ``user_table``, is represented by a 64 dimension
# embedding of size 4096.
# 

ebc = torchrec.EmbeddingBagCollection(
    device="cpu",
    tables=[
        torchrec.EmbeddingBagConfig(
            name="product_table",
            embedding_dim=64,
            num_embeddings=4096,
            feature_names=["product"],
            pooling=torchrec.PoolingType.SUM,
        ),
        torchrec.EmbeddingBagConfig(
            name="user_table",
            embedding_dim=64,
            num_embeddings=4096,
            feature_names=["user"],
            pooling=torchrec.PoolingType.SUM,
        )
    ]
)
print(ebc.embedding_bags)


######################################################################
# Let’s inspect the forward method for ``EmbeddingBagCollection`` and the
# module’s inputs and outputs:
# 

import inspect

# Let's look at the ``EmbeddingBagCollection`` forward method
# What is a ``KeyedJaggedTensor`` and ``KeyedTensor``?
print(inspect.getsource(ebc.forward))


######################################################################
# TorchRec Input/Output Data Types
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# TorchRec has distinct data types for input and output of its modules:
# ``JaggedTensor``, ``KeyedJaggedTensor``, and ``KeyedTensor``. Now you
# might ask, why create new data types to represent sparse features? To
# answer that question, we must understand how sparse features are
# represented in code.
# 
# Sparse features are otherwise known as ``id_list_feature`` and
# ``id_score_list_feature``, and are the **IDs** that will be used as
# indices to an embedding table to retrieve the embedding for that ID. To
# give a very simple example, imagine a single sparse feature being Ads
# that a user interacted with. The input itself would be a set of Ad IDs
# that a user interacted with, and the embeddings retrieved would be a
# semantic representation of those Ads. The tricky part of representing
# these features in code is that in each input example, **the number of
# IDs is variable**. One day a user might have interacted with only one ad
# while the next day they interact with three.
# 
# A simple representation is shown below, where we have a ``lengths``
# tensor denoting how many indices are in an example for a batch and a
# ``values`` tensor containing the indices themselves.
# 

# Batch Size 2
# 1 ID in example 1, 2 IDs in example 2
id_list_feature_lengths = torch.tensor([1, 2])

# Values (IDs) tensor: ID 5 is in example 1, ID 7, 1 is in example 2
id_list_feature_values = torch.tensor([5, 7, 1])


######################################################################
# Next, let's look at the offsets as well as what is contained in each batch
# 

# Lengths can be converted to offsets for easy indexing of values
id_list_feature_offsets = torch.cumsum(id_list_feature_lengths, dim=0)

print("Offsets: ", id_list_feature_offsets)
print("First Batch: ", id_list_feature_values[: id_list_feature_offsets[0]])
print(
    "Second Batch: ",
    id_list_feature_values[id_list_feature_offsets[0] : id_list_feature_offsets[1]],
)

from torchrec import JaggedTensor

# ``JaggedTensor`` is just a wrapper around lengths/offsets and values tensors!
jt = JaggedTensor(values=id_list_feature_values, lengths=id_list_feature_lengths)

# Automatically compute offsets from lengths
print("Offsets: ", jt.offsets())

# Convert to list of values
print("List of Values: ", jt.to_dense())

# ``__str__`` representation
print(jt)

from torchrec import KeyedJaggedTensor

# ``JaggedTensor`` represents IDs for 1 feature, but we have multiple features in an ``EmbeddingBagCollection``
# That's where ``KeyedJaggedTensor`` comes in! ``KeyedJaggedTensor`` is just multiple ``JaggedTensors`` for multiple id_list_feature_offsets
# From before, we have our two features "product" and "user". Let's create ``JaggedTensors`` for both!

product_jt = JaggedTensor(
    values=torch.tensor([1, 2, 1, 5]), lengths=torch.tensor([3, 1])
)
user_jt = JaggedTensor(values=torch.tensor([2, 3, 4, 1]), lengths=torch.tensor([2, 2]))

# Q1: How many batches are there, and which values are in the first batch for ``product_jt`` and ``user_jt``?
kjt = KeyedJaggedTensor.from_jt_dict({"product": product_jt, "user": user_jt})

# Look at our feature keys for the ``KeyedJaggedTensor``
print("Keys: ", kjt.keys())

# Look at the overall lengths for the ``KeyedJaggedTensor``
print("Lengths: ", kjt.lengths())

# Look at all values for ``KeyedJaggedTensor``
print("Values: ", kjt.values())

# Can convert ``KeyedJaggedTensor`` to dictionary representation
print("to_dict: ", kjt.to_dict())

# ``KeyedJaggedTensor`` string representation
print(kjt)

# Q2: What are the offsets for the ``KeyedJaggedTensor``?

# Now we can run a forward pass on our ``EmbeddingBagCollection`` from before
result = ebc(kjt)
result

# Result is a ``KeyedTensor``, which contains a list of the feature names and the embedding results
print(result.keys())

# The results shape is [2, 128], as batch size of 2. Reread previous section if you need a refresher on how the batch size is determined
# 128 for dimension of embedding. If you look at where we initialized the ``EmbeddingBagCollection``, we have two tables "product" and "user" of dimension 64 each
# meaning embeddings for both features are of size 64. 64 + 64 = 128
print(result.values().shape)

# Nice to_dict method to determine the embeddings that belong to each feature
result_dict = result.to_dict()
for key, embedding in result_dict.items():
    print(key, embedding.shape)


######################################################################
# Congrats! You now understand TorchRec modules and data types.
# Give yourself a pat on the back for making it this far. Next, we will
# learn about distributed training and sharding.
# 


######################################################################
# Distributed Training and Sharding
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# Now that we have a grasp on TorchRec modules and data types, it's time
# to take it to the next level.
# 
# Remember, the main purpose of TorchRec is to provide primitives for
# distributed embeddings. So far, we've only worked with embedding tables
# on a single device. This has been possible given how small the embedding tables
# have been, but in a production setting this isn't generally the case.
# Embedding tables often get massive, where one table can't fit on a single
# GPU, creating the requirement for multiple devices and a distributed
# environment.
# 
# In this section, we will explore setting up a distributed environment,
# exactly how actual production training is done, and explore sharding
# embedding tables, all with TorchRec.
# 
# **This section will also only use 1 GPU, though it will be treated in a
# distributed fashion. This is only a limitation for training, as training
# has a process per GPU. Inference does not run into this requirement**
# 
# In the example code below, we set up our PyTorch distributed environment.
#
# .. warning:: 
#    If you are running this in Google Colab, you can only call this cell once,
#    calling it again will cause an error as you can only initialize the process
#    group once.

import os

import torch.distributed as dist

# Set up environment variables for distributed training
# RANK is which GPU we are on, default 0
os.environ["RANK"] = "0"
# How many devices in our "world", colab notebook can only handle 1 process
os.environ["WORLD_SIZE"] = "1"
# Localhost as we are training locally
os.environ["MASTER_ADDR"] = "localhost"
# Port for distributed training
os.environ["MASTER_PORT"] = "29500"

# nccl backend is for GPUs, gloo is for CPUs
dist.init_process_group(backend="gloo")

print(f"Distributed environment initialized: {dist}")


######################################################################
# Distributed Embeddings
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# We have already worked with the main TorchRec module:
# ``EmbeddingBagCollection``. We have examined how it works along with how
# data is represented in TorchRec. However, we have not yet explored one
# of the main parts of TorchRec, which is **distributed embeddings**.
# 
# GPUs are the most popular choice for ML workloads by far today, as they
# are able to do magnitudes more floating point operations/s
# (`FLOPs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS>`__) than CPU. However,
# GPUs come with the limitation of scarce fast memory (HBM which is
# analogous to RAM for CPU), typically, ~10s of GBs.
# 
# A RecSys model can contain embedding tables that far exceed the memory
# limit for 1 GPU, hence the need for distribution of the embedding tables
# across multiple GPUs, otherwise known as **model parallel**. On the
# other hand, **data parallel** is where the entire model is replicated on
# each GPU, which each GPU taking in a distinct batch of data for
# training, syncing gradients on the backwards pass.
# 
# Parts of the model that **require less compute but more memory
# (embeddings) are distributed with model parallel** while parts that
# **require more compute and less memory (dense layers, MLP, etc.) are
# distributed with data parallel**.
# 
# Sharding
# ~~~~~~~~
# 
# In order to distribute an embedding table, we split up the embedding
# table into parts and place those parts onto different devices, also
# known as “sharding”.
# 
# There are many ways to shard embedding tables. The most common ways are:
#
# * Table-Wise: the table is placed entirely onto one device
# * Column-Wise: columns of embedding tables are sharded
# * Row-Wise: rows of embedding tables are sharded
# 
# Sharded Modules
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# While all of this seems like a lot to deal with and implement, you're in
# luck. **TorchRec provides all the primitives for easy distributed
# training and inference**! In fact, TorchRec modules have two corresponding
# classes for working with any TorchRec module in a distributed
# environment:
#
# * **The module sharder**: This class exposes a ``shard`` API
#   that handles sharding a TorchRec Module, producing a sharded module.
#   * For ``EmbeddingBagCollection``, the sharder is `EmbeddingBagCollectionSharder <https://pytorch.org/torchrec/torchrec.distributed.html#torchrec.distributed.embeddingbag.EmbeddingBagCollectionSharder>`__
# * **Sharded module**: This class is a sharded variant of a TorchRec module.
#   It has the same input/output as a the regular TorchRec module, but much
#   more optimized and works in a distributed environment.
#   * For ``EmbeddingBagCollection``, the sharded variant is `ShardedEmbeddingBagCollection <https://pytorch.org/torchrec/torchrec.distributed.html#torchrec.distributed.embeddingbag.ShardedEmbeddingBagCollection>`__
# 
# Every TorchRec module has an unsharded and sharded variant.
# 
# * The unsharded version is meant to be prototyped and experimented with.
# * The sharded version is meant to be used in a distributed environment for
#   distributed training and inference.
# 
# The sharded versions of TorchRec modules, for example
# ``EmbeddingBagCollection``, will handle everything that is needed for Model
# Parallelism, such as communication between GPUs for distributing
# embeddings to the correct GPUs.
# 
# Refresher of our ``EmbeddingBagCollection`` module

from torchrec.distributed.embeddingbag import EmbeddingBagCollectionSharder

sharder = EmbeddingBagCollectionSharder()

# ``ProcessGroup`` from torch.distributed initialized 2 cells above

assert pg is not None, "Process group is not initialized"

print(f"Process Group: {pg}")


######################################################################
# Planner
# ~~~~~~~
# 
# Before we can show how sharding works, we must know about the
# **planner**, which helps us determine the best sharding configuration.
# 
# Given a number of embedding tables and a number of ranks, there are many
# different sharding configurations that are possible. For example, given
# 2 embedding tables and 2 GPUs, you can:
#
# * Place 1 table on each GPU
# * Place both tables on a single GPU and no tables on the other
# * Place certain rows and columns on each GPU
# 
# Given all of these possibilities, we typically want a sharding
# configuration that is optimal for performance.
# 
# That is where the planner comes in. The planner is able to determine
# given the number of embedding tables and the number of GPUs, what is the optimal
# configuration. Turns out, this is incredibly difficult to do manually,
# with tons of factors that engineers have to consider to ensure an
# optimal sharding plan. Luckily, TorchRec provides an auto planner when
# the planner is used. 
# 
# The TorchRec planner:
# 
# * Assesses memory constraints of hardware
# * Estimates compute based on memory fetches as embedding lookups
# * Addresses data specific factors
# * Considers other hardware specifics like bandwidth to generate an optimal sharding plan
# 
# In order to take into consideration all these variables, The TorchRec
# planner can take in `various amounts of data for embedding tables,
# constraints, hardware information, and
# topology <https://github.com/pytorch/torchrec/blob/main/torchrec/distributed/planner/planners.py#L147-L155>`__
# to aid in generating the optimal sharding plan for a model, which is
# routinely provided across stacks.
# 
# To learn more about sharding, see our `sharding
# tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/sharding.html>`__.
# 

# In our case, 1 GPU and compute on CUDA device
planner = EmbeddingShardingPlanner(
    topology=Topology(
        world_size=1,
        compute_device="cuda",
    )
)

# Run planner to get plan for sharding
plan = planner.collective_plan(ebc, [sharder], pg)

print(f"Sharding Plan generated: {plan}")


######################################################################
# Planner Result
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# As you can see above, when running the planner there is quite a bit of output.
# We can see a lot of stats being calculated along with where our
# tables end up being placed.
# 
# The result of running the planner is a static plan, which can be reused
# for sharding! This allows sharding to be static for production models
# instead of determining a new sharding plan everytime. Below, we use the
# sharding plan to finally generate our ``ShardedEmbeddingBagCollection``.

# GPU Training with ``LazyAwaitable``
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# 
# Remember that TorchRec is a highly optimized library for distributed
# embeddings. A concept that TorchRec introduces to enable higher
# performance for training on GPU is a
# `LazyAwaitable <https://pytorch.org/torchrec/torchrec.distributed.html#torchrec.distributed.types.LazyAwaitable>`__.
# You will see ``LazyAwaitable`` types as outputs of various sharded
# TorchRec modules. All a ``LazyAwaitable`` type does is delay calculating some
# result as long as possible, and it does it by acting like an async type.
# 

from typing import List

from torchrec.distributed.types import LazyAwaitable


# Demonstrate a ``LazyAwaitable`` type:

######################################################################
# Anatomy of Sharded TorchRec modules
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# We have now successfully sharded an ``EmbeddingBagCollection`` given a
# sharding plan that we generated! The sharded module has common APIs from
# TorchRec which abstract away distributed communication/compute amongst
# multiple GPUs. In fact, these APIs are highly optimized for performance
# in training and inference. **Below are the three common APIs for
# distributed training/inference** that are provided by TorchRec:
# 
# * ``input_dist``: Handles distributing inputs from GPU to GPU.
# * ``lookups``: Does the actual embedding lookup in an optimized,
#   batched manner using FBGEMM TBE (more on this later).
# * ``output_dist``: Handles distributing outputs from GPU to GPU.
# 
# The distribution of inputs and outputs is done through `NCCL
# Collectives <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/overview.html>`__,
# namely
# `All-to-Alls <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/usage/p2p.html#all-to-all>`__,
# which is where all GPUs send and receive data to and from one another.
# TorchRec interfaces with PyTorch distributed for collectives and
# provides clean abstractions to the end users, removing the concern for
# the lower level details.
# 
# The backwards pass does all of these collectives but in the reverse
# order for distribution of gradients. ``input_dist``, ``lookup``, and
# ``output_dist`` all depend on the sharding scheme. Since we sharded in a
# table-wise fashion, these APIs are modules that are constructed by
# `TwPooledEmbeddingSharding <https://pytorch.org/torchrec/torchrec.distributed.sharding.html#torchrec.distributed.sharding.tw_sharding.TwPooledEmbeddingSharding>`__.
# 

sharded_ebc

# Distribute input KJTs to all other GPUs and receive KJTs
sharded_ebc._input_dists

# Distribute output embeddings to all other GPUs and receive embeddings
sharded_ebc._output_dists


######################################################################
# Optimizing Embedding Lookups
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# In performing lookups for a collection of embedding tables, a trivial
# solution would be to iterate through all the ``nn.EmbeddingBags`` and do
# a lookup per table. This is exactly what the standard, unsharded
# ``EmbeddingBagCollection`` does. However, while this solution
# is simple, it is extremely slow.
# 
# `FBGEMM <https://github.com/pytorch/FBGEMM/tree/main/fbgemm_gpu>`__ is a
# library that provides GPU operators (otherwise known as kernels) that
# are very optimized. One of these operators is known as **Table Batched
# Embedding** (TBE), provides two major optimizations:
# 
# -  Table batching, which allows you to look up multiple embeddings with
#    one kernel call.
# -  Optimizer Fusion, which allows the module to update itself given the
#    canonical pytorch optimizers and arguments.
# 
# The ``ShardedEmbeddingBagCollection`` uses the FBGEMM TBE as the lookup
# instead of traditional ``nn.EmbeddingBags`` for optimized embedding
# lookups.

# ``DistributedModelParallel``
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# We have now explored sharding a single ``EmbeddingBagCollection``! We were
# able to take the ``EmbeddingBagCollectionSharder`` and use the unsharded
# ``EmbeddingBagCollection`` to generate a
# ``ShardedEmbeddingBagCollection`` module. This workflow is fine, but
# typically when implementing model parallel,
# `DistributedModelParallel <https://pytorch.org/torchrec/torchrec.distributed.html#torchrec.distributed.model_parallel.DistributedModelParallel>`__
# (DMP) is used as the standard interface. When wrapping your model (in
# our case ``ebc``), with DMP, the following will occur:
# 
# 1. Decide how to shard the model. DMP will collect the available
#    sharders and come up with a plan of the optimal way to shard the
#    embedding table(s) (for example, ``EmbeddingBagCollection``)
# 2. Actually shard the model. This includes allocating memory for each
#    embedding table on the appropriate device(s).
# 
# DMP takes in everything that we've just experimented with, like a static
# sharding plan, a list of sharders, etc. However, it also has some nice
# defaults to seamlessly shard a TorchRec model. In this toy example,
# since we have two embedding tables and one GPU, TorchRec will place both
# on the single GPU.

# Sharding Best Practices
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# Currently, our configuration is only sharding on 1 GPU (or rank), which
# is trivial: just place all the tables on 1 GPUs memory. However, in real
# production use cases, embedding tables are **typically sharded on
# hundreds of GPUs**, with different sharding methods such as table-wise,
# row-wise, and column-wise. It is incredibly important to determine a
# proper sharding configuration (to prevent out of memory issues) while
# keeping it balanced not only in terms of memory but also compute for
# optimal performance.
# 


######################################################################
# Adding in the Optimizer
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# Remember that TorchRec modules are hyperoptimized for large scale
# distributed training. An important optimization is in regards to the
# optimizer. 
#
# TorchRec modules provide a seamless API to fuse the
# backwards pass and optimize step in training, providing a significant
# optimization in performance and decreasing the memory used, alongside
# granularity in assigning distinct optimizers to distinct model
# parameters.
# 
# Optimizer Classes
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# 
# TorchRec uses ``CombinedOptimizer``, which contains a collection of
# ``KeyedOptimizers``. A ``CombinedOptimizer`` effectively makes it easy
# to handle multiple optimizers for various sub groups in the model. A
# ``KeyedOptimizer`` extends the ``torch.optim.Optimizer`` and is
# initialized through a dictionary of parameters exposes the parameters.
# Each ``TBE`` module in a ``EmbeddingBagCollection`` will have it's own
# ``KeyedOptimizer`` which combines into one ``CombinedOptimizer``.
# 
# Fused optimizer in TorchRec
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# 
# Using ``DistributedModelParallel``, the **optimizer is fused, which
# means that the optimizer update is done in the backward**. This is an
# optimization in TorchRec and FBGEMM, where the optimizer embedding
# gradients are not materialized and applied directly to the parameters.
# This brings significant memory savings as embedding gradients are
# typically size of the parameters themselves.
# 
# You can, however, choose to make the optimizer ``dense`` which does not
# apply this optimization and let's you inspect the embedding gradients or
# apply computations to it as you wish. A dense optimizer in this case
# would be your `canonical PyTorch model training loop with
# optimizer. <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/optimization_tutorial.html>`__
# 
# Once the optimizer is created through ``DistributedModelParallel``, you
# still need to manage an optimizer for the other parameters not
# associated with TorchRec embedding modules. To find the other
# parameters,
# use ``in_backward_optimizer_filter(model.named_parameters())``. 
# Apply an optimizer to those parameters as you would a normal Torch
# optimizer and combine this and the ``model.fused_optimizer`` into one
# ``CombinedOptimizer`` that you can use in your training loop to
# ``zero_grad`` and ``step`` through.
# 
# Adding an Optimizer to ``EmbeddingBagCollection``
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# 
# We will do this in two ways, which are equivalent, but give you options
# depending on your preferences:
#
# 1. Passing optimizer kwargs through ``fused_params`` in sharder.
# 2. Through ``apply_optimizer_in_backward``, which converts the optimizer
#    parameters to ``fused_params`` to pass to the ``TBE`` in the ``EmbeddingBagCollection`` or ``EmbeddingCollection``.
# 

# Option 1: Passing optimizer kwargs through fused parameters

# Inference
# ~~~~~~~~~
# 
# Now that we are able to train distributed embeddings, how can we take
# the trained model and optimize it for inference? Inference is typically
# very sensitive to **performance and size of the model**. Running just
# the trained model in a Python environment is incredibly inefficient.
# There are two key differences between inference and training
# environments:
# 
# * **Quantization**: Inference models are typically
#   quantized, where model parameters lose precision for lower latency in
#   predictions and reduced model size. For example FP32 (4 bytes) in
#   trained model to INT8 (1 byte) for each embedding weight. This is also
#   necessary given the vast scale of embedding tables, as we want to use as
#   few devices as possible for inference to minimize latency.
#
# * **C++ environment**: Inference latency is very important, so in order to ensure
#   ample performance, the model is typically ran in a C++ environment,
#   along with the situations where we don't have a Python runtime, like on
#   device.
# 
# TorchRec provides primitives for converting a TorchRec model into being
# inference ready with:
# 
# * APIs for quantizing the model, introducing
#   optimizations automatically with FBGEMM TBE
# * Sharding embeddings for distributed inference
# * Compiling the model to `TorchScript <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html>`__
#   (compatible in C++)
# 
# In this section, we will go over this entire workflow of:
# 
# * Quantizing the model
# * Sharding the quantized model
# * Compiling the sharded quantized model into TorchScript

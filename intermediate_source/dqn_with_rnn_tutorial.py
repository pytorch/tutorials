# Overview
# --------
#
# Memory-based policies are crucial not only when the observations are partially
# observable but also when the time dimension must be taken into account to
# make informed decisions.
#
# Recurrent neural network have long been a popular tool for memory-based
# policies. The idea is to keep a recurrent state in memory between two
# consecutive steps, and use this as an input to the policy along with the
# current observation.
#
# This tutorial shows how to incorporate an RNN in a policy using TorchRL.
#
# Key learnings:
#
# - Incorporating an RNN in an actor in TorchRL;
# - Using that memory-based policy with a replay buffer and a loss module.
#
# The core idea of using RNNs in TorchRL is to use TensorDict as a data carrier
# for the hidden states from one step to another. We'll build a policy that
# reads the previous recurrent state from the current TensorDict, and writes the
# current recurrent states in the TensorDict of the next state:
#
# .. figure:: /_static/img/rollout_recurrent.png
#    :alt: Data collection with a recurrent policy
#
# As this figure shows, our environment populates the TensorDict with zeroed recurrent
# states which are read by the policy together with the observation to produce an
# action, and recurrent states that will be used for the next step.
# When the :func:`~torchrl.envs.utils.step_mdp` function is called, the recurrent states
# from the next state are brought to the current TensorDict. Let's see how this
# is implemented in practice.

# Environment
# -----------
#
# As usual, the first step is to build our environment: it helps us
# define the problem and build the policy network accordingly. For this tutorial,
# we'll be running a single pixel-based instance of the CartPole gym
# environment with some custom transforms: turning to grayscale, resizing to
# 84x84, scaling down the rewards and normalizing the observations.
#
# .. note::
#   The :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.StepCounter` transform is accessory. Since the CartPole
#   task goal is to make trajectories as long as possible, counting the steps
#   can help us track the performance of our policy.
#
# Two transforms are important for the purpose of this tutorial:
#
# - :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.InitTracker` will stamp the
#   calls to :meth:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase.reset` by adding a ``"is_init"``
#   boolean mask in the TensorDict that will track which steps require a reset
#   of the RNN hidden states.
# - The :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.TensorDictPrimer` transform is a bit more
#   technical. It is not required to use RNN policies. However, it
#   instructs the environment (and subsequently the collector) that some extra
#   keys are to be expected. Once added, a call to `env.reset()` will populate
#   the entries indicated in the primer with zeroed tensors. Knowing that
#   these tensors are expected by the policy, the collector will pass them on
#   during collection. Eventually, we'll be storing our hidden states in the
#   replay buffer, which will help us bootstrap the computation of the
#   RNN operations in the loss module (which would otherwise be initiated
#   with 0s). In summary: not including this transform will not impact hugely
#   the training of our policy, but it will make the recurrent keys disappear
#   from the collected data and the replay buffer, which will in turn lead to
#   a slightly less optimal training.
#   Fortunately, the :class:`~torchrl.modules.LSTMModule` we propose is
#   equipped with a helper method to build just that transform for us, so
#   we can wait until we build it!
#

env = TransformedEnv(
    GymEnv("CartPole-v1", from_pixels=True, device=device),
    Compose(
        ToTensorImage(),
        GrayScale(),
        Resize(84, 84),
        StepCounter(),
        InitTracker(),
        RewardScaling(loc=0.0, scale=0.1),
        ObservationNorm(standard_normal=True, in_keys=["pixels"]),
    ),
)

######################################################################
# As always, we need to initialize manually our normalization constants:
#
env.transform[-1].init_stats(1000, reduce_dim=[0, 1, 2], cat_dim=0, keep_dims=[0])
td = env.reset()

######################################################################
# Policy
# ------
#
# Our policy will have 3 components: a :class:`~torchrl.modules.ConvNet`
# backbone, an :class:`~torchrl.modules.LSTMModule` memory layer and a shallow
# :class:`~torchrl.modules.MLP` block that will map the LSTM output onto the
# action values.
#
# Convolutional network
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# We build a convolutional network flanked with a :class:`torch.nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d`
# that will squash the output in a vector of size 64. The :class:`~torchrl.modules.ConvNet`
# can assist us with this:
#

feature = Mod(
    ConvNet(
        num_cells=[32, 32, 64],
        squeeze_output=True,
        aggregator_class=nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d,
        aggregator_kwargs={"output_size": (1, 1)},
        device=device,
    ),
    in_keys=["pixels"],
    out_keys=["embed"],
)
######################################################################
# we execute the first module on a batch of data to gather the size of the
# output vector:
#
n_cells = feature(env.reset())["embed"].shape[-1]

######################################################################
# LSTM Module
# ~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# TorchRL provides a specialized :class:`~torchrl.modules.LSTMModule` class
# to incorporate LSTMs in your code-base. It is a :class:`~tensordict.nn.TensorDictModuleBase`
# subclass: as such, it has a set of ``in_keys`` and ``out_keys`` that indicate
# what values should be expected to be read and written/updated during the
# execution of the module. The class comes with customizable predefined
# values for these attributes to facilitate its construction.
#
# .. note::
#   *Usage limitations*: The class supports almost all LSTM features such as
#   dropout or multi-layered LSTMs.
#   However, to respect TorchRL's conventions, this LSTM must have the ``batch_first``
#   attribute set to ``True`` which is **not** the default in PyTorch. However,
#   our :class:`~torchrl.modules.LSTMModule` changes this default
#   behavior, so we're good with a native call.
#
#   Also, the LSTM cannot have a ``bidirectional`` attribute set to ``True`` as
#   this wouldn't be usable in online settings. In this case, the default value
#   is the correct one.
#

lstm = LSTMModule(
    input_size=n_cells,
    hidden_size=128,
    device=device,
    in_key="embed",
    out_key="embed",
)

######################################################################
# Let us look at the LSTM Module class, specifically its in and out_keys:
print("in_keys", lstm.in_keys)
print("out_keys", lstm.out_keys)

######################################################################
# We can see that these values contain the key we indicated as the in_key (and out_key)
# as well as recurrent key names. The out_keys are preceded by a "next" prefix
# that indicates that they will need to be written in the "next" TensorDict.
# We use this convention (which can be overridden by passing the in_keys/out_keys
# arguments) to make sure that a call to :func:`~torchrl.envs.utils.step_mdp` will
# move the recurrent state to the root TensorDict, making it available to the
# RNN during the following call (see figure in the intro).
#
# As mentioned earlier, we have one more optional transform to add to our
# environment to make sure that the recurrent states are passed to the buffer.
# The :meth:`~torchrl.modules.LSTMModule.make_tensordict_primer` method does
# exactly that:
#
env.append_transform(lstm.make_tensordict_primer())

######################################################################
# and that's it! We can print the environment to check that everything looks good now
# that we have added the primer:
print(env)

######################################################################
# MLP
# ~~~
#
# We use a single-layer MLP to represent the action values we'll be using for
# our policy.
#
mlp = MLP(
    out_features=2,
    num_cells=[
        64,
    ],
    device=device,
)
######################################################################
# and fill the bias with zeros:

mlp[-1].bias.data.fill_(0.0)
mlp = Mod(mlp, in_keys=["embed"], out_keys=["action_value"])

######################################################################
# Using the Q-Values to select an action
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The last part of our policy is the Q-Value Module.
# The Q-Value module :class:`~torchrl.modules.tensordict_module.QValueModule`
# will read the ``"action_values"`` key that is produced by our MLP and
# from it, gather the action that has the maximum value.
# The only thing we need to do is to specify the action space, which can be done
# either by passing a string or an action-spec. This allows us to use
# Categorical (sometimes called "sparse") encoding or the one-hot version of it.
#
qval = QValueModule(spec=env.action_spec)

######################################################################
# .. note::
#   TorchRL also provides a wrapper class :class:`torchrl.modules.QValueActor` that
#   wraps a module in a Sequential together with a :class:`~torchrl.modules.tensordict_module.QValueModule`
#   like we are doing explicitly here. There is little advantage to do this
#   and the process is less transparent, but the end results will be similar to
#   what we do here.
#
# We can now put things together in a :class:`~tensordict.nn.TensorDictSequential`
#
stoch_policy = Seq(feature, lstm, mlp, qval)

######################################################################
# DQN being a deterministic algorithm, exploration is a crucial part of it.
# We'll be using an :math:`\epsilon`-greedy policy with an epsilon of 0.2 decaying
# progressively to 0.
# This decay is achieved via a call to :meth:`~torchrl.modules.EGreedyModule.step`
# (see training loop below).
#
exploration_module = EGreedyModule(
    annealing_num_steps=1_000_000, spec=env.action_spec, eps_init=0.2
)
stoch_policy = Seq(
    stoch_policy,
    exploration_module,
)

######################################################################
# Using the model for the loss
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The model as we've built it is well equipped to be used in sequential settings.
# However, the class :class:`torch.nn.LSTM` can use a cuDNN-optimized backend
# to run the RNN sequence faster on GPU device. We would not want to miss
# such an opportunity to speed up our training loop!
# To use it, we just need to tell the LSTM module to run on "recurrent-mode"
# when used by the loss.
# As we'll usually want to have two copies of the LSTM module, we do this by
# calling a :meth:`~torchrl.modules.LSTMModule.set_recurrent_mode` method that
# will return a new instance of the LSTM (with shared weights) that will
# assume that the input data is sequential in nature.
#
policy = Seq(feature, lstm.set_recurrent_mode(True), mlp, qval)

######################################################################
# Because we still have a couple of uninitialized parameters we should
# initialize them before creating an optimizer and such.
#
policy(env.reset())

######################################################################
# DQN Loss
# --------
#
# Out DQN loss requires us to pass the policy and, again, the action-space.
# While this may seem redundant, it is important as we want to make sure that
# the :class:`~torchrl.objectives.DQNLoss` and the :class:`~torchrl.modules.tensordict_module.QValueModule`
# classes are compatible, but aren't strongly dependent on each other.
#
# To use the Double-DQN, we ask for a ``delay_value`` argument that will
# create a non-differentiable copy of the network parameters to be used
# as a target network.
loss_fn = DQNLoss(policy, action_space=env.action_spec, delay_value=True)

######################################################################
# Since we are using a double DQN, we need to update the target parameters.
# We'll use a  :class:`~torchrl.objectives.SoftUpdate` instance to carry out
# this work.
#
updater = SoftUpdate(loss_fn, eps=0.95)

optim = torch.optim.Adam(policy.parameters(), lr=3e-4)

######################################################################
# Collector and replay buffer
# ---------------------------
#
# We build the simplest data collector there is. We'll try to train our algorithm
# with a million frames, extending the buffer with 50 frames at a time. The buffer
# will be designed to store 20 thousands trajectories of 50 steps each.
# At each optimization step (16 per data collection), we'll collect 4 items
# from our buffer, for a total of 200 transitions.
# We'll use a :class:`~torchrl.data.replay_buffers.LazyMemmapStorage` storage to keep the data
# on disk.
#
# .. note::
#   For the sake of efficiency, we're only running a few thousands iterations
#   here. In a real setting, the total number of frames should be set to 1M.
#
collector = SyncDataCollector(env, stoch_policy, frames_per_batch=50, total_frames=200, device=device)

# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# We have seen how an RNN can be incorporated in a policy in TorchRL.
# You should now be able:
#
# - Create an LSTM module that acts as a :class:`~tensordict.nn.TensorDictModule`
# - Indicate to the LSTM module that a reset is needed via an :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.InitTracker`
#   transform
# - Incorporate this module in a policy and in a loss module
# - Make sure that the collector is made aware of the recurrent state entries
#   such that they can be stored in the replay buffer along with the rest of
#   the data

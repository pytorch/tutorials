Multinode training involves deploying a training job across several
machines. There are two ways to do this:

-  running a ``torchrun`` command on each machine with identical rendezvous arguments, or
-  deploying it on a compute cluster using a workload manager (like SLURM)

In this video we will go over the (minimal) code changes required to move from single-node multigpu to
multinode training, and run our training script in both of the above ways.

Note that multinode training is bottlenecked by inter-node communication latencies. Running a training job
on 4 GPUs on a single node will be faster than running it on 4 nodes with 1 GPU each.

Local and Global ranks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In single-node settings, we were tracking the 
``gpu_id`` of each device running our training process. ``torchrun`` tracks this value in an environment variable ``LOCAL_RANK``
which uniquely identifies each GPU-process on a node. For a unique identifier across all the nodes, ``torchrun`` provides another variable
``RANK`` which refers to the global rank of a process.

.. warning::
   Do not use ``RANK`` for critical logic in your training job. When ``torchrun`` restarts processes after a failure or membership changes, there is no guarantee
   that the processes will hold the same ``LOCAL_RANK`` and ``RANKS``. 
 

Heteregeneous Scaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Torchrun supports *heteregenous scaling* i.e. each of your multinode machines can have different number of 
GPUs participating in the training job. In the video, I deployed the code on 2 machines where one machine has 4 GPUs and the
other used only 2 GPUs.


Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Ensure that your nodes are able to communicate with each other over
   TCP.
-  Set env variable ``NCCL_DEBUG`` to ``INFO`` (using
   ``export NCCL_DEBUG=INFO``) to print verbose logs that can help
   diagnose the issue.
-  Sometimes you might need to explicitly set the network interface for
   the distributed backend (``export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=eth0``). Read
   more about this
   `here <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#choosing-the-network-interface-to-use>`__.

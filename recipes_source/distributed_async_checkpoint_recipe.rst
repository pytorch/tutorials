Asynchronous Saving with Distributed Checkpoint (DCP)

Checkpointing is often a bottle-neck in the critical path for distributed training workloads, incurring larger and larger costs as both model and world sizes grow.
One excellent strategy for offsetting this cost is to checkpoint in parallel, asynchronously. Below, we expand the save example
from the `Getting Started with Distributed Checkpoint Tutorial <https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/blob/main/recipes_source/distributed_checkpoint_recipe.rst>`__
to show how this can be integrated quite easily with ``torch.distributed.checkpoint.async_save``.

Asynchronous Checkpointing Overview
------------------------------------
Before getting started with Asynchronous Checkpointing, it's important to understand it's differences and limitations as compared to synchronous checkpointing.
Specifically:

* Memory requirements - Asynchronous checkpointing works by first copying models into internal CPU-buffers.
    This is helpful since it ensures model and optimizer weights are not changing while the model is still checkpointing,
    but does raise CPU memory by a factor of ``checkpoint_size_per_rank X number_of_ranks``. Additionally, users should take care to understand
    the memory constraints of their systems. Specifically, pinned memory implies the usage of ``page-lock`` memory, which can be scarce as compared to
    ``pageable`` memory.

* Checkpoint Management - Since checkpointing is asynchronous, it is up to the user to manage concurrently run checkpoints. In general, users can
    employ their own management strategies by handling the future object returned form ``async_save``. For most users, we recommend limiting
    checkpoints to one asynchronous request at a time, avoiding additional memory pressure per request.

        )


Even more performance with Pinned Memory
-----------------------------------------
If the above optimization is still not performant enough, you can take advantage of an additional optimization for GPU models which utilizes a pinned memory buffer for checkpoint staging.
Specifically, this optimization attacks the main overhead of asynchronous checkpointing, which is the in-memory copying to checkpointing buffers. By maintaining a pinned memory buffer between
checkpoint requests users can take advantage of direct memory access to speed up this copy.

.. note::
   The main drawback of this optimization is the persistence of the buffer in between checkpointing steps. Without
   the pinned memory optimization (as demonstrated above), any checkpointing buffers are released as soon as
   checkpointing is finished. With the pinned memory implementation, this buffer is maintained between steps,
   leading to the same
   peak memory pressure being sustained through the application life.

Conclusion
----------
In conclusion, we have learned how to use DCP's :func:`async_save` API to generate checkpoints off the critical training path. We've also learned about the
additional memory and concurrency overhead introduced by using this API, as well as additional optimizations which utilize pinned memory to speed things up
even further.

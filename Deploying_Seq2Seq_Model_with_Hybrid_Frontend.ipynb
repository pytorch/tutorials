    "# Deploying a Seq2Seq Model with the Hybrid Frontend\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will walk through the process of transitioning a sequence-to-sequence model to Torch Script using PyTorch's Hybrid Frontend. The model that we will convert is the chatbot model from the [Chatbot tutorial](). While the [introductory Hybrid Frontend tutorials]() are useful for gaining an understanding of the work-flow, purpose, and basic syntax of the feature, this document covers a more challenging model and a more practical use-case. You can either treat this tutorial as a \"Part 2\" to the [Chatbot tutorial]() and deploy your own pretrained model, or you can start with this document and use a pretrained model that we host. In the latter case, you can reference the original [Chatbot tutorial]() for details regarding data preprocessing, model theory and definition, and model training.\n",

    "## What is the Hybrid Frontend?\n",
    "During the research and development phase of a deep learning-based project, it is advantageous to interact with an **eager**, imperative interface like PyTorch's. This gives users the ability to write familiar, idiomatic Python, allowing for the use of Python data structures, control flow operations, print statements, and debugging utilities. Although the eager interface is a beneficial tool for research and experimentation applications, when it comes time to deploy the model in a production environment, having a **graph**-based model representation is very beneficial. A deferred graph representation allows for optimizations such as out-of-order execution, and the ability to target highly optimized hardware architectures. Also, a graph-based representation enables framework-agnostic model exportation. PyTorch provides mechanisms for incrementally converting eager-mode code into Torch Script, a statically analyzable and optimizable subset of Python that Torch uses to represent deep learning programs independently from the Python runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API for converting eager-mode PyTorch programs into Torch Script is found in the torch.jit module. This module has two core modalities for converting an eager-mode model to a Torch Script graph representation: **tracing** and **scripting**. The `torch.jit.trace` function takes a module or function and a set of example inputs. It then runs the example input through the function or module while tracing the computational steps that are encountered, and outputs a graph-based function that performs the traced operations. **Tracing** is great for straightforward modules and functions that do not involve data-dependent control flow, such as standard convolutional neural networks. However, if a function with data-dependent if statements and loops is traced, only the operations called along the execution route taken by the example input will be recorded. In other words, the control flow itself is not captured. To convert modules and functions containing data-dependent control flow, a **scripting** mechanism is provided. Scripting explicitly converts the module or function code to Torch Script, including all possible control flow routes. To use script mode, be sure to inherit from the the `torch.jit.ScriptModule` base class (instead of `torch.nn.Module`) and add a `torch.jit.script` decorator to your Python function or a `torch.jit.script_method` decorator to your module's methods. The one caveat with using scripting is that it only supports a restricted subset of Python. For all details relating to the supported features, see the Torch Script [language reference](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/jit.html). To provide the maximum flexibility, the modes of Torch Script can be composed to represent your whole program, and these techniques can be applied incrementally.\n",

    "\n",
    "As mentioned, the model that we are using is a [sequence-to-sequence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215) (seq2seq) model. This type of model is used in cases when our input is a variable-length sequence, and our output is also a variable length sequence that is not necessarily a one-to-one mapping of the input. A seq2seq model is comprised of two recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that work cooperatively: an **encoder** and a **decoder**.\n",

    "### Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder RNN iterates through the input sentence one token (e.g. word) at a time, at each time step outputting an \"output\" vector and a \"hidden state\" vector. The hidden state vector is then passed to the next time step, while the output vector is recorded. The encoder transforms the context it saw at each point in the sequence into a set of points in a high-dimensional space, which the decoder will use to generate a meaningful output for the given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoder RNN generates the response sentence in a token-by-token fashion. It uses the encoder's context vectors, and internal hidden states to generate the next word in the sequence. It continues generating words until it outputs an *EOS_token*, representing the end of the sentence. We use an [attention mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) in our decoder to help it to \"pay attention\" to certain parts of the input when generating the output. For our model, we implement [Luong et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025)'s \"Global attention\" module, and use it as a submodule in our decode model."

    "Although our models conceptually deal with sequences of tokens, in reality, they deal with numbers like all machine learning models do. In this case, every word in the model's vocabulary, which was established before training, is mapped to an integer index. We use a `Voc` object to contain the mappings from word to index, as well as the total number of words in the vocabulary. We will load the object later before we run the model.\n",
    " \n",
    "Also, in order for us to be able to run evaluations, we must provide a tool for processing our string inputs. The `normalizeString` function converts all characters in a string to lowercase and removes all non-letter characters. The `indexesFromSentence` function takes a sentence of words and returns the corresponding sequence of word indexes."

    "We implement our encoder's RNN with the `torch.nn.GRU` module which we feed a batch of sentences (vectors of word embeddings) and it internally iterates through the sentences one token at a time calculating the hidden states. We initialize this module to be bidirectional, meaning that we have two independent GRUs: one that iterates through the sequences in chronological order, and another that iterates in reverse order. We ultimately return the sum of these two GRUs' outputs. Since our model was trained using batching, our `EncoderRNN` model's `forward` function expects a padded input batch. To batch variable-length sentences, we allow a maximum of *MAX_LENGTH* tokens in a sentence, and all sentences in the batch that have less than *MAX_LENGTH* tokens are padded at the end with our dedicated *PAD_token* tokens. To use padded batches with a PyTorch RNN module, we must wrap the forward pass call with `torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence` and `torch.nn.utils.rnn.pad_packed_sequence` data transformations. Note that the `forward` function also takes an `input_lengths` list, which contains the length of each sentence in the batch. This input is used by the `torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence` function when padding.\n",

To decode a given decoder output, we must iteratively run forward passes through our decoder model, which outputs softmax scores corresponding to the probability of each word being the correct next word in the decoded sequence. We initialize the `decoder_input` to a tensor containing an *SOS_token*. After each pass through the `decoder`, we *greedily* append the word with the highest softmax probability to the `decoded_words` list. We also use this word as the `decoder_input` for the next iteration.

    "The `forward` method of this module involves iterating over the range of $[0, max\\_length)$ when decoding an output sequence one word at a time. Because of this, we should use **scripting** to convert this module to Torch Script. Unlike with our encoder and decoder models, which we can trace, we must make some necessary changes to the `GreedySearchDecoder` module in order to initialize an object without error. In other words, we must ensure that our module adheres to the rules of the scripting mechanism, and does not utilize any language features outside of the subset of Python that Torch Script includes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an idea of some manipulations that may be required, we will go over the diffs between the `GreedySearchDecoder` implementation from the chatbot tutorial and the implementation that we use in the cell below. Note that the lines highlighted in red are lines removed from the original implementation and the lines highlighted in green are new.\n",

    "#### Changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `nn.Module` -> `torch.jit.ScriptModule`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In order to use PyTorch's scripting mechanism on a module, that module must inherit from the `torch.jit.ScriptModule`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Added `decoder_n_layers` to the constructor arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This change stems from the fact that the encoder and decoder models that we pass to this module will be a child of `TracedModule` (not `Module`). Therefore, we cannot access the decoder's number of layers with `decoder.n_layers`. Instead, we plan for this, and pass this value in during module construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Store away new attributes as constants\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In the original implementation, we were free to use variables from the surrounding (global) scope in our `GreedySearchDecoder`'s `forward` method. However, now that we are using scripting, we do not have this freedom, as the assumption with scripting is that we cannot necessarily hold on to Python objects, especially when exporting. An easy solution to this is to store these values from the global scope as attributes to the module in the constructor, and add them to a special list called `__constants__` so that they can be used as literal values when constructing the graph in the `forward` method. An example of this usage is on NEW line 19, where instead of using the `device` and `SOS_token` global values, we use our constant attributes `self._device` and `self._SOS_token`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add the `torch.jit.script_method` decorator to the `forward` method\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Adding this decorator lets the JIT compiler know that the function that it is decorating should be scripted.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Enforce types of `forward` method arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "    - By default, all parameters to a Torch Script function are assumed to be Tensor. If we need to pass an argument of a different type, we can use function type annotations as introduced in [PEP 3107](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/). In addition, it is possible to declare arguments of different types using MyPy-style type annotations (see [doc](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/jit.html#types)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change initialization of `decoder_input`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In the original implementation, we initialized our `decoder_input` tensor with `torch.LongTensor([[SOS_token]])`. When scripting, we are not allowed to initialize tensors in a literal fashion like this. Instead, we can initialize our tensor with an explicit torch function such as `torch.ones`. In this case, we can easily replicate the scalar `decoder_input` tensor by multiplying 1 by our SOS_token value stored in the constant `self._SOS_token`.\n"

    "Next, we define some functions for evaluating an input. The `evaluate` function takes a normalized string sentence, processes it to a tensor of its corresponding word indexes  (with batch size of 1), and passes this tensor to a `GreedySearchDecoder` instance called `searcher` to handle the encoding/decoding process. The searcher returns the output word index vector and a scores tensor corresponding to the softmax scores for each decoded word token. The final step is to convert each word index back to its string representation using `voc.index2word`.\n",

    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, to convert the encoder model to Torch Script, we use **tracing**. Tracing any module requires running an example input through the model's `forward` method and trace the computational graph that the data encounters. The encoder model takes an input sequence and a corresponding lengths tensor. Therefore, we create an example input sequence tensor `test_seq`, which is of appropriate size (MAX_LENGTH, 1), contains numbers in the appropriate range $[0, voc.num\\_words)$, and is of the appropriate type (int64). We also create a `test_seq_length` scalar which realistically contains the value corresponding to how many words are in the `test_seq`. The next step is to use the `torch.jit.trace` function to trace the model. Notice that the first argument we pass is the module that we want to trace, and the second is a tuple of arguments to the module's `forward` method.\n",

This method is possible because in our case we do not have any constraints on the values of the tensors because we do not have any operations that could fault on out-of-range inputs.\n",

######################################################################
# In this tutorial, we explore a fun and interesting use-case of recurrent
# sequence-to-sequence models. We will train a simple chatbot using movie
# scripts from the `Cornell Movie-Dialogs
# Corpus <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html>`__.
#
# Conversational models are a hot topic in artificial intelligence
# research. Chatbots can be found in a variety of settings, including
# customer service applications and online helpdesks. These bots are often
# powered by retrieval-based models, which output predefined responses to
# questions of certain forms. In a highly restricted domain like a
# company’s IT helpdesk, these models may be sufficient, however, they are
# not robust enough for more general use-cases. Teaching a machine to
# carry out a meaningful conversation with a human in multiple domains is
# a research question that is far from solved. Recently, the deep learning
# boom has allowed for powerful generative models like Google’s `Neural
# Conversational Model <https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869>`__, which marks
# a large step towards multi-domain generative conversational models. In
# this tutorial, we will implement this kind of model in PyTorch.

# Preparations
# ------------
#
# To get started, `download <https://zissou.infosci.cornell.edu/convokit/datasets/movie-corpus/movie-corpus.zip>`__ the Movie-Dialogs Corpus zip file.

# and put in a ``data/`` directory under the current directory.
#
# After that, let’s import some necessities.

# Load & Preprocess Data
# ----------------------
#
# The next step is to reformat our data file and load the data into
# structures that we can work with.
#
# The `Cornell Movie-Dialogs
# Corpus <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html>`__
# is a rich dataset of movie character dialog:

#    characters
# -  9,035 characters from 617 movies
# -  304,713 total utterances
#
# This dataset is large and diverse, and there is a great variation of
# language formality, time periods, sentiment, etc. Our hope is that this
# diversity makes our model robust to many forms of inputs and queries.
#
# First, we’ll take a look at some lines of our datafile to see the
# original format.

# Load and trim data
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Our next order of business is to create a vocabulary and load
# query/response sentence pairs into memory.
#
# Note that we are dealing with sequences of **words**, which do not have
# an implicit mapping to a discrete numerical space. Thus, we must create
# one by mapping each unique word that we encounter in our dataset to an
# index value.
#
# For this we define a ``Voc`` class, which keeps a mapping from words to
# indexes, a reverse mapping of indexes to words, a count of each word and
# a total word count. The class provides methods for adding a word to the
# vocabulary (``addWord``), adding all words in a sentence
# (``addSentence``) and trimming infrequently seen words (``trim``). More
# on trimming later.

# Now we can assemble our vocabulary and query/response sentence pairs.
# Before we are ready to use this data, we must perform some

# First, we must convert the Unicode strings to ASCII using

# trim all non-letter characters except for basic punctuation
# (``normalizeString``). Finally, to aid in training convergence, we will

######################################################################
# Another tactic that is beneficial to achieving faster convergence during

# Prepare Data for Models
# -----------------------
#
# Although we have put a great deal of effort into preparing and massaging our
# data into a nice vocabulary object and list of sentence pairs, our models
# will ultimately expect numerical torch tensors as inputs. One way to
# prepare the processed data for the models can be found in the `seq2seq
# translation
# tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html>`__.
# In that tutorial, we use a batch size of 1, meaning that all we have to
# do is convert the words in our sentence pairs to their corresponding
# indexes from the vocabulary and feed this to the models.
#
# However, if you’re interested in speeding up training and/or would like
# to leverage GPU parallelization capabilities, you will need to train
# with mini-batches.
#
# Using mini-batches also means that we must be mindful of the variation
# of sentence length in our batches. To accommodate sentences of different
# sizes in the same batch, we will make our batched input tensor of shape
# *(max_length, batch_size)*, where sentences shorter than the
# *max_length* are zero padded after an *EOS_token*.
#
# If we simply convert our English sentences to tensors by converting
# words to their indexes(\ ``indexesFromSentence``) and zero-pad, our
# tensor would have shape *(batch_size, max_length)* and indexing the
# first dimension would return a full sequence across all time-steps.
# However, we need to be able to index our batch along time, and across
# all sequences in the batch. Therefore, we transpose our input batch
# shape to *(max_length, batch_size)*, so that indexing across the first
# dimension returns a time step across all sentences in the batch. We
# handle this transpose implicitly in the ``zeroPadding`` function.
#
# .. figure:: /_static/img/chatbot/seq2seq_batches.png
#    :align: center
#    :alt: batches
#
# The ``inputVar`` function handles the process of converting sentences to
# tensor, ultimately creating a correctly shaped zero-padded tensor. It
# also returns a tensor of ``lengths`` for each of the sequences in the
# batch which will be passed to our decoder later.
#
# The ``outputVar`` function performs a similar function to ``inputVar``,
# but instead of returning a ``lengths`` tensor, it returns a binary mask
# tensor and a maximum target sentence length. The binary mask tensor has
# the same shape as the output target tensor, but every element that is a
# *PAD_token* is 0 and all others are 1.
#
# ``batch2TrainData`` simply takes a bunch of pairs and returns the input
# and target tensors using the aforementioned functions.

# Define Models
# -------------
#
# Seq2Seq Model
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The brains of our chatbot is a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model. The
# goal of a seq2seq model is to take a variable-length sequence as an
# input, and return a variable-length sequence as an output using a
# fixed-sized model.
#
# `Sutskever et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__ discovered that
# by using two separate recurrent neural nets together, we can accomplish
# this task. One RNN acts as an **encoder**, which encodes a variable
# length input sequence to a fixed-length context vector. In theory, this
# context vector (the final hidden layer of the RNN) will contain semantic
# information about the query sentence that is input to the bot. The
# second RNN is a **decoder**, which takes an input word and the context
# vector, and returns a guess for the next word in the sequence and a
# hidden state to use in the next iteration.

# Encoder
# ~~~~~~~
#
# The encoder RNN iterates through the input sentence one token
# (e.g. word) at a time, at each time step outputting an “output” vector
# and a “hidden state” vector. The hidden state vector is then passed to
# the next time step, while the output vector is recorded. The encoder
# transforms the context it saw at each point in the sequence into a set
# of points in a high-dimensional space, which the decoder will use to
# generate a meaningful output for the given task.
#
# At the heart of our encoder is a multi-layered Gated Recurrent Unit,
# invented by `Cho et al. <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078v3.pdf>`__ in
# 2014. We will use a bidirectional variant of the GRU, meaning that there
# are essentially two independent RNNs: one that is fed the input sequence
# in normal sequential order, and one that is fed the input sequence in
# reverse order. The outputs of each network are summed at each time step.
# Using a bidirectional GRU will give us the advantage of encoding both
# past and future contexts.
#
# Bidirectional RNN:
#
# .. figure:: /_static/img/chatbot/RNN-bidirectional.png

#    :align: center
#    :alt: rnn_bidir
#
# Image source: https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/
#
# Note that an ``embedding`` layer is used to encode our word indices in
# an arbitrarily sized feature space. For our models, this layer will map
# each word to a feature space of size *hidden_size*. When trained, these
# values should encode semantic similarity between similar meaning words.
#
# Finally, if passing a padded batch of sequences to an RNN module, we
# must pack and unpack padding around the RNN pass using
# ``nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence`` and
# ``nn.utils.rnn.pad_packed_sequence`` respectively.
#
# **Computation Graph:**
#
#    1) Convert word indexes to embeddings.
#    2) Pack padded batch of sequences for RNN module.
#    3) Forward pass through GRU.
#    4) Unpack padding.
#    5) Sum bidirectional GRU outputs.
#    6) Return output and final hidden state.
#
# **Inputs:**
#
# -  ``input_seq``: batch of input sentences; shape=\ *(max_length,
#    batch_size)*
# -  ``input_lengths``: list of sentence lengths corresponding to each
#    sentence in the batch; shape=\ *(batch_size)*
# -  ``hidden``: hidden state; shape=\ *(n_layers x num_directions,
#    batch_size, hidden_size)*
#
# **Outputs:**
#
# -  ``outputs``: output features from the last hidden layer of the GRU
#    (sum of bidirectional outputs); shape=\ *(max_length, batch_size,
#    hidden_size)*
# -  ``hidden``: updated hidden state from GRU; shape=\ *(n_layers x

# Decoder
# ~~~~~~~
#
# The decoder RNN generates the response sentence in a token-by-token
# fashion. It uses the encoder’s context vectors, and internal hidden
# states to generate the next word in the sequence. It continues
# generating words until it outputs an *EOS_token*, representing the end
# of the sentence. A common problem with a vanilla seq2seq decoder is that
# if we rely solely on the context vector to encode the entire input
# sequence’s meaning, it is likely that we will have information loss.
# This is especially the case when dealing with long input sequences,
# greatly limiting the capability of our decoder.
#
# To combat this, `Bahdanau et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`__
# created an “attention mechanism” that allows the decoder to pay
# attention to certain parts of the input sequence, rather than using the
# entire fixed context at every step.
#
# At a high level, attention is calculated using the decoder’s current
# hidden state and the encoder’s outputs. The output attention weights
# have the same shape as the input sequence, allowing us to multiply them
# by the encoder outputs, giving us a weighted sum which indicates the
# parts of encoder output to pay attention to. `Sean
# Robertson’s <https://github.com/spro>`__ figure describes this very
# well:
#
# .. figure:: /_static/img/chatbot/attn2.png
#    :align: center
#    :alt: attn2
#
# `Luong et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025>`__ improved upon
# Bahdanau et al.’s groundwork by creating “Global attention”. The key
# difference is that with “Global attention”, we consider all of the
# encoder’s hidden states, as opposed to Bahdanau et al.’s “Local
# attention”, which only considers the encoder’s hidden state from the
# current time step. Another difference is that with “Global attention”,
# we calculate attention weights, or energies, using the hidden state of
# the decoder from the current time step only. Bahdanau et al.’s attention
# calculation requires knowledge of the decoder’s state from the previous
# time step. Also, Luong et al. provides various methods to calculate the
# attention energies between the encoder output and decoder output which
# are called “score functions”:
#
# .. figure:: /_static/img/chatbot/scores.png
#    :width: 60%
#    :align: center
#    :alt: scores
#
# where :math:`h_t` = current target decoder state and :math:`\bar{h}_s` =
# all encoder states.
#
# Overall, the Global attention mechanism can be summarized by the
# following figure. Note that we will implement the “Attention Layer” as a
# separate ``nn.Module`` called ``Attn``. The output of this module is a
# softmax normalized weights tensor of shape *(batch_size, 1,
# max_length)*.

# Masked loss
# ~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Since we are dealing with batches of padded sequences, we cannot simply
# consider all elements of the tensor when calculating loss. We define
# ``maskNLLLoss`` to calculate our loss based on our decoder’s output
# tensor, the target tensor, and a binary mask tensor describing the
# padding of the target tensor. This loss function calculates the average
# negative log likelihood of the elements that correspond to a *1* in the
# mask tensor.

# Single training iteration
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The ``train`` function contains the algorithm for a single training
# iteration (a single batch of inputs).
#
# We will use a couple of clever tricks to aid in convergence:
#
# -  The first trick is using **teacher forcing**. This means that at some
#    probability, set by ``teacher_forcing_ratio``, we use the current
#    target word as the decoder’s next input rather than using the
#    decoder’s current guess. This technique acts as training wheels for
#    the decoder, aiding in more efficient training. However, teacher
#    forcing can lead to model instability during inference, as the
#    decoder may not have a sufficient chance to truly craft its own
#    output sequences during training. Thus, we must be mindful of how we
#    are setting the ``teacher_forcing_ratio``, and not be fooled by fast
#    convergence.
#
# -  The second trick that we implement is **gradient clipping**. This is
#    a commonly used technique for countering the “exploding gradient”
#    problem. In essence, by clipping or thresholding gradients to a
#    maximum value, we prevent the gradients from growing exponentially
#    and either overflow (NaN), or overshoot steep cliffs in the cost
#    function.

#    :width: 60%
#    :alt: grad_clip
#
# Image source: Goodfellow et al. *Deep Learning*. 2016. https://www.deeplearningbook.org/
#
# **Sequence of Operations:**
#
#    1) Forward pass entire input batch through encoder.
#    2) Initialize decoder inputs as SOS_token, and hidden state as the encoder's final hidden state.
#    3) Forward input batch sequence through decoder one time step at a time.
#    4) If teacher forcing: set next decoder input as the current target; else: set next decoder input as current decoder output.
#    5) Calculate and accumulate loss.
#    6) Perform backpropagation.
#    7) Clip gradients.
#    8) Update encoder and decoder model parameters.
#
#
# .. Note ::
#
#   PyTorch’s RNN modules (``RNN``, ``LSTM``, ``GRU``) can be used like any
#   other non-recurrent layers by simply passing them the entire input
#   sequence (or batch of sequences). We use the ``GRU`` layer like this in
#   the ``encoder``. The reality is that under the hood, there is an
#   iterative process looping over each time step calculating hidden states.
#   Alternatively, you can run these modules one time-step at a time. In
#   this case, we manually loop over the sequences during the training
#   process like we must do for the ``decoder`` model. As long as you
#   maintain the correct conceptual model of these modules, implementing
#   sequential models can be very straightforward.

# Greedy decoding
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Greedy decoding is the decoding method that we use during training when
# we are **NOT** using teacher forcing. In other words, for each time
# step, we simply choose the word from ``decoder_output`` with the highest
# softmax value. This decoding method is optimal on a single time-step
# level.
#
# To facilitate the greedy decoding operation, we define a
# ``GreedySearchDecoder`` class. When run, an object of this class takes
# an input sequence (``input_seq``) of shape *(input_seq length, 1)*, a
# scalar input length (``input_length``) tensor, and a ``max_length`` to
# bound the response sentence length. The input sentence is evaluated
# using the following computational graph:
#
# **Computation Graph:**
#
#    1) Forward input through encoder model.
#    2) Prepare encoder's final hidden layer to be first hidden input to the decoder.
#    3) Initialize decoder's first input as SOS_token.
#    4) Initialize tensors to append decoded words to.
#    5) Iteratively decode one word token at a time:
#        a) Forward pass through decoder.
#        b) Obtain most likely word token and its softmax score.
#        c) Record token and score.
#        d) Prepare current token to be next decoder input.

# Evaluate my text
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Now that we have our decoding method defined, we can write functions for
# evaluating a string input sentence. The ``evaluate`` function manages
# the low-level process of handling the input sentence. We first format
# the sentence as an input batch of word indexes with *batch_size==1*. We
# do this by converting the words of the sentence to their corresponding
# indexes, and transposing the dimensions to prepare the tensor for our
# models. We also create a ``lengths`` tensor which contains the length of
# our input sentence. In this case, ``lengths`` is scalar because we are
# only evaluating one sentence at a time (batch_size==1). Next, we obtain
# the decoded response sentence tensor using our ``GreedySearchDecoder``
# object (``searcher``). Finally, we convert the response’s indexes to
# words and return the list of decoded words.
#
# ``evaluateInput`` acts as the user interface for our chatbot. When
# called, an input text field will spawn in which we can enter our query
# sentence. After typing our input sentence and pressing *Enter*, our text
# is normalized in the same way as our training data, and is ultimately
# fed to the ``evaluate`` function to obtain a decoded output sentence. We
# loop this process, so we can keep chatting with our bot until we enter
# either “q” or “quit”.
#
# Finally, if a sentence is entered that contains a word that is not in
# the vocabulary, we handle this gracefully by printing an error message
# and prompting the user to enter another sentence.

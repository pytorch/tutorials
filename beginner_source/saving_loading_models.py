Saving and Loading Models
=========================
**Author:** `Matthew Inkawhich <https://github.com/MatthewInkawhich>`_

This document provides solutions to a variety of use cases regarding the
saving and loading of PyTorch models. Feel free to read the whole
document, or just skip to the code you need for a desired use case.

When it comes to saving and loading models, there are three core
functions to be familiar with:

1) `torch.save <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html?highlight=save#torch.save>`__:
   Saves a serialized object to disk. This function uses Python’s
   `pickle <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>`__ utility
   for serialization. Models, tensors, and dictionaries of all kinds of
   objects can be saved using this function.

2) `torch.load <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html?highlight=torch%20load#torch.load>`__:
   Uses `pickle <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>`__\ ’s
   unpickling facilities to deserialize pickled object files to memory.
   This function also facilitates the device to load the data into (see
   `Saving & Loading Model Across
   Devices <#saving-loading-model-across-devices>`__).

3) `torch.nn.Module.load_state_dict <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html?highlight=load_state_dict#torch.nn.Module.load_state_dict>`__:
   Loads a model’s parameter dictionary using a deserialized
   *state_dict*. For more information on *state_dict*, see `What is a
   state_dict? <#what-is-a-state-dict>`__.

# What is a ``state_dict``?
# -------------------------
#
# In PyTorch, the learnable parameters (i.e. weights and biases) of an
# ``torch.nn.Module`` model are contained in the model’s *parameters*
# (accessed with ``model.parameters()``). A *state_dict* is simply a
# Python dictionary object that maps each layer to its parameter tensor.
# Note that only layers with learnable parameters (convolutional layers,
# linear layers, etc.) and registered buffers (batchnorm's running_mean)
# have entries in the model’s *state_dict*. Optimizer
# objects (``torch.optim``) also have a *state_dict*, which contains
# information about the optimizer's state, as well as the hyperparameters
# used.
#
# Because *state_dict* objects are Python dictionaries, they can be easily
# saved, updated, altered, and restored, adding a great deal of modularity
# to PyTorch models and optimizers.
#
# Example:
# ^^^^^^^^
#
# Let’s take a look at the *state_dict* from the simple model used in the
# `Training a
# classifier <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-cifar10-tutorial-py>`__
# tutorial.
#
# .. code:: python
#
#    # Define model
#    class TheModelClass(nn.Module):
#        def __init__(self):
#            super(TheModelClass, self).__init__()
#            self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
#            self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
#            self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
#            self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
#            self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
#            self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)
#
#        def forward(self, x):
#            x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
#            x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
#            x = x.view(-1, 16 * 5 * 5)
#            x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
#            x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
#            x = self.fc3(x)
#            return x
#
#    # Initialize model
#    model = TheModelClass()
#
#    # Initialize optimizer
#    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)
#
#    # Print model's state_dict
#    print("Model's state_dict:")
#    for param_tensor in model.state_dict():
#        print(param_tensor, "\t", model.state_dict()[param_tensor].size())
#
#    # Print optimizer's state_dict
#    print("Optimizer's state_dict:")
#    for var_name in optimizer.state_dict():
#        print(var_name, "\t", optimizer.state_dict()[var_name])

# Saving & Loading Model for Inference
# ------------------------------------
#
# Save/Load ``state_dict`` (Recommended)
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# **Save:**
#
# .. code:: python
#
#    torch.save(model.state_dict(), PATH)
#
# **Load:**
#
# .. code:: python
#
#    model = TheModelClass(*args, **kwargs)
#    model.load_state_dict(torch.load(PATH, weights_only=True))
#    model.eval()
#
# .. note::
#     The 1.6 release of PyTorch switched ``torch.save`` to use a new
#     zip file-based format. ``torch.load`` still retains the ability to
#     load files in the old format. If for any reason you want ``torch.save``
#     to use the old format, pass the ``kwarg`` parameter ``_use_new_zipfile_serialization=False``.
#
# When saving a model for inference, it is only necessary to save the
# trained model’s learned parameters. Saving the model’s *state_dict* with
# the ``torch.save()`` function will give you the most flexibility for
# restoring the model later, which is why it is the recommended method for
# saving models.
#
# A common PyTorch convention is to save models using either a ``.pt`` or
# ``.pth`` file extension.
#
# Remember that you must call ``model.eval()`` to set dropout and batch
# normalization layers to evaluation mode before running inference.
# Failing to do this will yield inconsistent inference results.
#
# .. note::
#
#    Notice that the ``load_state_dict()`` function takes a dictionary
#    object, NOT a path to a saved object. This means that you must
#    deserialize the saved *state_dict* before you pass it to the
#    ``load_state_dict()`` function. For example, you CANNOT load using
#    ``model.load_state_dict(PATH)``.
#
# .. note::
#    
#    If you only plan to keep the best performing model (according to the 
#    acquired validation loss), don't forget that ``best_model_state = model.state_dict()``
#    returns a reference to the state and not its copy! You must serialize 
#    ``best_model_state`` or use ``best_model_state = deepcopy(model.state_dict())`` otherwise
#    your best ``best_model_state`` will keep getting updated by the subsequent training 
#    iterations. As a result, the final model state will be the state of the overfitted model. 
#
# Save/Load Entire Model
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# **Save:**
#
# .. code:: python
#
#    torch.save(model, PATH)
#
# **Load:**
#
# .. code:: python
#
#    # Model class must be defined somewhere
#    model = torch.load(PATH, weights_only=False)
#    model.eval()
#
# This save/load process uses the most intuitive syntax and involves the
# least amount of code. Saving a model in this way will save the entire
# module using Python’s
# `pickle <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>`__ module. The
# disadvantage of this approach is that the serialized data is bound to
# the specific classes and the exact directory structure used when the
# model is saved. The reason for this is because pickle does not save the
# model class itself. Rather, it saves a path to the file containing the
# class, which is used during load time. Because of this, your code can
# break in various ways when used in other projects or after refactors.
#
# A common PyTorch convention is to save models using either a ``.pt`` or
# ``.pth`` file extension.
#
# Remember that you must call ``model.eval()`` to set dropout and batch
# normalization layers to evaluation mode before running inference.
# Failing to do this will yield inconsistent inference results.
#
# Export/Load Model in TorchScript Format
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# One common way to do inference with a trained model is to use
# `TorchScript <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html>`__, an intermediate
# representation of a PyTorch model that can be run in Python as well as in a
# high performance environment like C++. TorchScript is actually the recommended model format
# for scaled inference and deployment.
#
# .. note::
#    Using the TorchScript format, you will be able to load the exported model and
#    run inference without defining the model class.
#
# **Export:**
#
# .. code:: python
#
#    model_scripted = torch.jit.script(model) # Export to TorchScript
#    model_scripted.save('model_scripted.pt') # Save
#
# **Load:**
#
# .. code:: python
#
#    model = torch.jit.load('model_scripted.pt')
#    model.eval()
#
# Remember that you must call ``model.eval()`` to set dropout and batch
# normalization layers to evaluation mode before running inference.
# Failing to do this will yield inconsistent inference results.
#
# For more information on TorchScript, feel free to visit the dedicated
# `tutorials <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html>`__.
# You will get familiar with the tracing conversion and learn how to
# run a TorchScript module in a `C++ environment <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html>`__.

#    epoch = checkpoint['epoch']
#    loss = checkpoint['loss']
#
#    model.eval()
#    # - or -
#    model.train()
#
# When saving a general checkpoint, to be used for either inference or
# resuming training, you must save more than just the model’s
# *state_dict*. It is important to also save the optimizer's *state_dict*,
# as this contains buffers and parameters that are updated as the model
# trains. Other items that you may want to save are the epoch you left off
# on, the latest recorded training loss, external ``torch.nn.Embedding``
# layers, etc. As a result, such a checkpoint is often 2~3 times larger 
# than the model alone.
#
# To save multiple components, organize them in a dictionary and use
# ``torch.save()`` to serialize the dictionary. A common PyTorch
# convention is to save these checkpoints using the ``.tar`` file
# extension.
#
# To load the items, first initialize the model and optimizer, then load
# the dictionary locally using ``torch.load()``. From here, you can easily
# access the saved items by simply querying the dictionary as you would
# expect.
#
# Remember that you must call ``model.eval()`` to set dropout and batch
# normalization layers to evaluation mode before running inference.
# Failing to do this will yield inconsistent inference results. If you
# wish to resuming training, call ``model.train()`` to ensure these layers
# are in training mode.

#
# When saving a model comprised of multiple ``torch.nn.Modules``, such as

# follow the same approach as when you are saving a general checkpoint. In
# other words, save a dictionary of each model’s *state_dict* and
# corresponding optimizer. As mentioned before, you can save any other
# items that may aid you in resuming training by simply appending them to
# the dictionary.
#
# A common PyTorch convention is to save these checkpoints using the

#
# Partially loading a model or loading a partial model are common
# scenarios when transfer learning or training a new complex model.
# Leveraging trained parameters, even if only a few are usable, will help
# to warmstart the training process and hopefully help your model converge
# much faster than training from scratch.
#
# Whether you are loading from a partial *state_dict*, which is missing
# some keys, or loading a *state_dict* with more keys than the model that
# you are loading into, you can set the ``strict`` argument to **False**
# in the ``load_state_dict()`` function to ignore non-matching keys.
#
# If you want to load parameters from one layer to another, but some keys
# do not match, simply change the name of the parameter keys in the

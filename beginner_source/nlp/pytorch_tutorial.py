Introduction to Torch's tensor library
======================================

All of deep learning is computations on tensors, which are
generalizations of a matrix that can be indexed in more than 2
dimensions. We will see exactly what this means in-depth later. First,
let's look what we can do with tensors.

######################################################################
# Creating Tensors
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Tensors can be created from Python lists with the torch.tensor()
# function.
#

# torch.tensor(data) creates a torch.Tensor object with the given data.
V_data = [1., 2., 3.]
V = torch.tensor(V_data)
print(V)

# Creates a matrix
M_data = [[1., 2., 3.], [4., 5., 6]]
M = torch.tensor(M_data)
print(M)

# Create a 3D tensor of size 2x2x2.
T_data = [[[1., 2.], [3., 4.]],
          [[5., 6.], [7., 8.]]]
T = torch.tensor(T_data)
print(T)


######################################################################
# What is a 3D tensor anyway? Think about it like this. If you have a
# vector, indexing into the vector gives you a scalar. If you have a
# matrix, indexing into the matrix gives you a vector. If you have a 3D
# tensor, then indexing into the tensor gives you a matrix!
#
# A note on terminology:
# when I say "tensor" in this tutorial, it refers
# to any torch.Tensor object. Matrices and vectors are special cases of
# torch.Tensors, where their dimension is 2 and 1 respectively. When I am
# talking about 3D tensors, I will explicitly use the term "3D tensor".
#

# Index into V and get a scalar (0 dimensional tensor)
print(V[0])
# Get a Python number from it
print(V[0].item())

# Index into M and get a vector
print(M[0])

# Index into T and get a matrix
print(T[0])


######################################################################
# You can also create tensors of other data types. To create a tensor of integer types, try
# torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) (where all elements in the list are integers).
# You can also specify a data type by passing in ``dtype=torch.data_type``.
# Check the documentation for more data types, but
# Float and Long will be the most common.
#


######################################################################
# You can create a tensor with random data and the supplied dimensionality
# with torch.randn()
#

x = torch.randn((3, 4, 5))
print(x)


######################################################################
# Operations with Tensors
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# You can operate on tensors in the ways you would expect.

x = torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.])
y = torch.tensor([4., 5., 6.])
z = x + y
print(z)


######################################################################
# See `the documentation <https://pytorch.org/docs/torch.html>`__ for a
# complete list of the massive number of operations available to you. They
# expand beyond just mathematical operations.
#
# One helpful operation that we will make use of later is concatenation.
#

# By default, it concatenates along the first axis (concatenates rows)
x_1 = torch.randn(2, 5)
y_1 = torch.randn(3, 5)
z_1 = torch.cat([x_1, y_1])
print(z_1)

# Concatenate columns:
x_2 = torch.randn(2, 3)
y_2 = torch.randn(2, 5)
# second arg specifies which axis to concat along
z_2 = torch.cat([x_2, y_2], 1)
print(z_2)

# If your tensors are not compatible, torch will complain.  Uncomment to see the error
# torch.cat([x_1, x_2])


######################################################################
# Reshaping Tensors
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Use the .view() method to reshape a tensor. This method receives heavy
# use, because many neural network components expect their inputs to have
# a certain shape. Often you will need to reshape before passing your data
# to the component.
#

x = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)
print(x)
print(x.view(2, 12))  # Reshape to 2 rows, 12 columns
# Same as above.  If one of the dimensions is -1, its size can be inferred
print(x.view(2, -1))


######################################################################
# Computation Graphs and Automatic Differentiation
# ================================================
#
# The concept of a computation graph is essential to efficient deep
# learning programming, because it allows you to not have to write the
# back propagation gradients yourself. A computation graph is simply a
# specification of how your data is combined to give you the output. Since
# the graph totally specifies what parameters were involved with which
# operations, it contains enough information to compute derivatives. This
# probably sounds vague, so let's see what is going on using the
# fundamental flag ``requires_grad``.
#
# First, think from a programmers perspective. What is stored in the
# torch.Tensor objects we were creating above? Obviously the data and the
# shape, and maybe a few other things. But when we added two tensors
# together, we got an output tensor. All this output tensor knows is its
# data and shape. It has no idea that it was the sum of two other tensors
# (it could have been read in from a file, it could be the result of some
# other operation, etc.)
#
# If ``requires_grad=True``, the Tensor object keeps track of how it was
# created. Let's see it in action.
#

# Tensor factory methods have a ``requires_grad`` flag
x = torch.tensor([1., 2., 3], requires_grad=True)

# With requires_grad=True, you can still do all the operations you previously
# could
y = torch.tensor([4., 5., 6], requires_grad=True)
z = x + y
print(z)

# BUT z knows something extra.
print(z.grad_fn)


######################################################################
# So Tensors know what created them. z knows that it wasn't read in from
# a file, it wasn't the result of a multiplication or exponential or
# whatever. And if you keep following z.grad_fn, you will find yourself at
# x and y.
#
# But how does that help us compute a gradient?
#

# Let's sum up all the entries in z
s = z.sum()
print(s)
print(s.grad_fn)


######################################################################
# So now, what is the derivative of this sum with respect to the first
# component of x? In math, we want
#
# .. math::
#
#    \frac{\partial s}{\partial x_0}
#
#
#
# Well, s knows that it was created as a sum of the tensor z. z knows
# that it was the sum x + y. So
#
# .. math::  s = \overbrace{x_0 + y_0}^\text{$z_0$} + \overbrace{x_1 + y_1}^\text{$z_1$} + \overbrace{x_2 + y_2}^\text{$z_2$}
#
# And so s contains enough information to determine that the derivative
# we want is 1!
#
# Of course this glosses over the challenge of how to actually compute
# that derivative. The point here is that s is carrying along enough
# information that it is possible to compute it. In reality, the
# developers of Pytorch program the sum() and + operations to know how to
# compute their gradients, and run the back propagation algorithm. An
# in-depth discussion of that algorithm is beyond the scope of this
# tutorial.
#


######################################################################
# Let's have Pytorch compute the gradient, and see that we were right:
# (note if you run this block multiple times, the gradient will increment.
# That is because Pytorch *accumulates* the gradient into the .grad
# property, since for many models this is very convenient.)
#

# calling .backward() on any variable will run backprop, starting from it.
s.backward()
print(x.grad)


######################################################################
# Understanding what is going on in the block below is crucial for being a
# successful programmer in deep learning.
#

x = torch.randn(2, 2)
y = torch.randn(2, 2)
# By default, user created Tensors have ``requires_grad=False``
print(x.requires_grad, y.requires_grad)
z = x + y
# So you can't backprop through z
print(z.grad_fn)

# ``.requires_grad_( ... )`` changes an existing Tensor's ``requires_grad``
# flag in-place. The input flag defaults to ``True`` if not given.
x = x.requires_grad_()
y = y.requires_grad_()
# z contains enough information to compute gradients, as we saw above
z = x + y
print(z.grad_fn)
# If any input to an operation has ``requires_grad=True``, so will the output
print(z.requires_grad)

# Now z has the computation history that relates itself to x and y
# Can we just take its values, and **detach** it from its history?
new_z = z.detach()

# ... does new_z have information to backprop to x and y?
# NO!
print(new_z.grad_fn)
# And how could it? ``z.detach()`` returns a tensor that shares the same storage
# as ``z``, but with the computation history forgotten. It doesn't know anything
# about how it was computed.
# In essence, we have broken the Tensor away from its past history

###############################################################
# You can also stop autograd from tracking history on Tensors
# with ``.requires_grad=True`` by wrapping the code block in
# ``with torch.no_grad():``
print(x.requires_grad)
print((x ** 2).requires_grad)

with torch.no_grad():
	print((x ** 2).requires_grad)

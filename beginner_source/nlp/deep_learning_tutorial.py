Deep Learning Building Blocks: Affine maps, non-linearities and objectives
==========================================================================

Deep learning consists of composing linearities with non-linearities in
clever ways. The introduction of non-linearities allows for powerful
models. In this section, we will play with these core components, make
up an objective function, and see how the model is trained.


Affine Maps
~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the core workhorses of deep learning is the affine map, which is
a function :math:`f(x)` where

.. math::  f(x) = Ax + b

for a matrix :math:`A` and vectors :math:`x, b`. The parameters to be
learned here are :math:`A` and :math:`b`. Often, :math:`b` is refered to
as the *bias* term.


PyTorch and most other deep learning frameworks do things a little
differently than traditional linear algebra. It maps the rows of the
input instead of the columns. That is, the :math:`i`'th row of the
output below is the mapping of the :math:`i`'th row of the input under
:math:`A`, plus the bias term. Look at the example below.

lin = nn.Linear(5, 3)  # maps from R^5 to R^3, parameters A, b
# data is 2x5.  A maps from 5 to 3... can we map "data" under A?
data = torch.randn(2, 5)
print(lin(data))  # yes


######################################################################
# Non-Linearities
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# First, note the following fact, which will explain why we need
# non-linearities in the first place. Suppose we have two affine maps
# :math:`f(x) = Ax + b` and :math:`g(x) = Cx + d`. What is
# :math:`f(g(x))`?
#
# .. math::  f(g(x)) = A(Cx + d) + b = ACx + (Ad + b)
#
# :math:`AC` is a matrix and :math:`Ad + b` is a vector, so we see that
# composing affine maps gives you an affine map.
#
# From this, you can see that if you wanted your neural network to be long
# chains of affine compositions, that this adds no new power to your model
# than just doing a single affine map.
#
# If we introduce non-linearities in between the affine layers, this is no
# longer the case, and we can build much more powerful models.
#
# There are a few core non-linearities.
# :math:`\tanh(x), \sigma(x), \text{ReLU}(x)` are the most common. You are
# probably wondering: "why these functions? I can think of plenty of other
# non-linearities." The reason for this is that they have gradients that
# are easy to compute, and computing gradients is essential for learning.
# For example
#
# .. math::  \frac{d\sigma}{dx} = \sigma(x)(1 - \sigma(x))
#
# A quick note: although you may have learned some neural networks in your
# intro to AI class where :math:`\sigma(x)` was the default non-linearity,
# typically people shy away from it in practice. This is because the
# gradient *vanishes* very quickly as the absolute value of the argument
# grows. Small gradients means it is hard to learn. Most people default to
# tanh or ReLU.
#

# In pytorch, most non-linearities are in torch.functional (we have it imported as F)
# Note that non-linearites typically don't have parameters like affine maps do.
# That is, they don't have weights that are updated during training.
data = torch.randn(2, 2)
print(data)
print(F.relu(data))


######################################################################
# Softmax and Probabilities
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The function :math:`\text{Softmax}(x)` is also just a non-linearity, but
# it is special in that it usually is the last operation done in a
# network. This is because it takes in a vector of real numbers and
# returns a probability distribution. Its definition is as follows. Let
# :math:`x` be a vector of real numbers (positive, negative, whatever,
# there are no constraints). Then the i'th component of
# :math:`\text{Softmax}(x)` is
#
# .. math::  \frac{\exp(x_i)}{\sum_j \exp(x_j)}
#
# It should be clear that the output is a probability distribution: each
# element is non-negative and the sum over all components is 1.
#
# You could also think of it as just applying an element-wise
# exponentiation operator to the input to make everything non-negative and
# then dividing by the normalization constant.
#

# Softmax is also in torch.nn.functional
data = torch.randn(5)
print(data)
print(F.softmax(data, dim=0))
print(F.softmax(data, dim=0).sum())  # Sums to 1 because it is a distribution!
print(F.log_softmax(data, dim=0))  # theres also log_softmax


######################################################################
# Objective Functions
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The objective function is the function that your network is being
# trained to minimize (in which case it is often called a *loss function*
# or *cost function*). This proceeds by first choosing a training
# instance, running it through your neural network, and then computing the
# loss of the output. The parameters of the model are then updated by
# taking the derivative of the loss function. Intuitively, if your model
# is completely confident in its answer, and its answer is wrong, your
# loss will be high. If it is very confident in its answer, and its answer
# is correct, the loss will be low.
#
# The idea behind minimizing the loss function on your training examples
# is that your network will hopefully generalize well and have small loss
# on unseen examples in your dev set, test set, or in production. An
# example loss function is the *negative log likelihood loss*, which is a
# very common objective for multi-class classification. For supervised
# multi-class classification, this means training the network to minimize
# the negative log probability of the correct output (or equivalently,
# maximize the log probability of the correct output).
#


######################################################################
# Optimization and Training
# =========================
#
# So what we can compute a loss function for an instance? What do we do
# with that? We saw earlier that Tensors know how to compute gradients
# with respect to the things that were used to compute it. Well,
# since our loss is an Tensor, we can compute gradients with
# respect to all of the parameters used to compute it! Then we can perform
# standard gradient updates. Let :math:`\theta` be our parameters,
# :math:`L(\theta)` the loss function, and :math:`\eta` a positive
# learning rate. Then:
#
# .. math::  \theta^{(t+1)} = \theta^{(t)} - \eta \nabla_\theta L(\theta)
#
# There are a huge collection of algorithms and active research in
# attempting to do something more than just this vanilla gradient update.
# Many attempt to vary the learning rate based on what is happening at
# train time. You don't need to worry about what specifically these
# algorithms are doing unless you are really interested. Torch provides
# many in the torch.optim package, and they are all completely
# transparent. Using the simplest gradient update is the same as the more
# complicated algorithms. Trying different update algorithms and different
# parameters for the update algorithms (like different initial learning
# rates) is important in optimizing your network's performance. Often,
# just replacing vanilla SGD with an optimizer like Adam or RMSProp will
# boost performance noticably.
#

# Creating Network Components in PyTorch
# ======================================
#
# Before we move on to our focus on NLP, lets do an annotated example of
# building a network in PyTorch using only affine maps and
# non-linearities. We will also see how to compute a loss function, using
# PyTorch's built in negative log likelihood, and update parameters by
# backpropagation.
#
# All network components should inherit from nn.Module and override the
# forward() method. That is about it, as far as the boilerplate is
# concerned. Inheriting from nn.Module provides functionality to your
# component. For example, it makes it keep track of its trainable
# parameters, you can swap it between CPU and GPU with the ``.to(device)``
# method, where device can be a CPU device ``torch.device("cpu")`` or CUDA
# device ``torch.device("cuda:0")``.
#
# Let's write an annotated example of a network that takes in a sparse
# bag-of-words representation and outputs a probability distribution over
# two labels: "English" and "Spanish". This model is just logistic
# regression.
#


######################################################################
# Example: Logistic Regression Bag-of-Words classifier
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Our model will map a sparse BoW representation to log probabilities over
# labels. We assign each word in the vocab an index. For example, say our
# entire vocab is two words "hello" and "world", with indices 0 and 1
# respectively. The BoW vector for the sentence "hello hello hello hello"
# is
#
# .. math::  \left[ 4, 0 \right]
#
# For "hello world world hello", it is
#
# .. math::  \left[ 2, 2 \right]
#
# etc. In general, it is
#
# .. math::  \left[ \text{Count}(\text{hello}), \text{Count}(\text{world}) \right]
#
# Denote this BOW vector as :math:`x`. The output of our network is:
#
# .. math::  \log \text{Softmax}(Ax + b)
#
# That is, we pass the input through an affine map and then do log
# softmax.

# negative log likelihood loss we want. It also defines optimization
# functions in torch.optim. Here, we will just use SGD.

# target label. It doesn't compute the log probabilities for us. This is
# why the last layer of our network is log softmax. The loss function
# nn.CrossEntropyLoss() is the same as NLLLoss(), except it does the log
# softmax for you.

Introduction to PyTorch - YouTube Series
========================================

Authors:
`Brad Heintz <https://github.com/fbbradheintz>`_

This tutorial follows along with the `PyTorch Beginner Series <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_lsbAsL_o2CTlGHgMxNrKhzP97BaG9ZN>`_ on YouTube.

`This tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with Python and Deep Learning concepts.`

Running the Tutorial Code
-------------------------
You can run this tutorial in a couple of ways:

- **On the cloud**: This is the easiest way to get started! Each section has a Colab link at the top, which opens a notebook with the code in a fully-hosted environment. Pro tip: Use Colab with a GPU runtime to speed up operations *Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU*
- **Locally**: This option requires you to set up PyTorch and torchvision on your local machine (`installation instructions <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_). Download the notebook or copy the code into your favorite IDE.

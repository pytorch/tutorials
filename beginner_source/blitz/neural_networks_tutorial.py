Neural Networks
===============

Neural networks can be constructed using the ``torch.nn`` package.

Now that you had a glimpse of ``autograd``, ``nn`` depends on
``autograd`` to define models and differentiate them.
An ``nn.Module`` contains layers, and a method ``forward(input)`` that
returns the ``output``.

For example, look at this network that classifies digit images:

.. figure:: /_static/img/mnist.png
   :alt: convnet

   convnet

It is a simple feed-forward network. It takes the input, feeds it
through several layers one after the other, and then finally gives the
output.

A typical training procedure for a neural network is as follows:

- Define the neural network that has some learnable parameters (or
  weights)
- Iterate over a dataset of inputs
- Process input through the network
- Compute the loss (how far is the output from being correct)
- Propagate gradients back into the network’s parameters
- Update the weights of the network, typically using a simple update rule:
  ``weight = weight - learning_rate * gradient``

Define the network
------------------

Let’s define this network:
"""

    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()

        # Convolution layer C1: 1 input image channel, 6 output channels,
        # 5x5 square convolution, it uses RELU activation function, and
        # outputs a Tensor with size (N, 6, 28, 28), where N is the size of the batch

# .. note::
#
#     ``torch.nn`` only supports mini-batches. The entire ``torch.nn``
#     package only supports inputs that are a mini-batch of samples, and not
#     a single sample.
#
#     For example, ``nn.Conv2d`` will take in a 4D Tensor of
#     ``nSamples x nChannels x Height x Width``.
#
#     If you have a single sample, just use ``input.unsqueeze(0)`` to add
#     a fake batch dimension.
#
# Before proceeding further, let's recap all the classes you’ve seen so far.
#
# **Recap:**
#   -  ``torch.Tensor`` - A *multi-dimensional array* with support for autograd
#      operations like ``backward()``. Also *holds the gradient* w.r.t. the
#      tensor.
#   -  ``nn.Module`` - Neural network module. *Convenient way of
#      encapsulating parameters*, with helpers for moving them to GPU,
#      exporting, loading, etc.
#   -  ``nn.Parameter`` - A kind of Tensor, that is *automatically
#      registered as a parameter when assigned as an attribute to a*
#      ``Module``.
#   -  ``autograd.Function`` - Implements *forward and backward definitions
#      of an autograd operation*. Every ``Tensor`` operation creates at
#      least a single ``Function`` node that connects to functions that
#      created a ``Tensor`` and *encodes its history*.
#
# **At this point, we covered:**
#   -  Defining a neural network
#   -  Processing inputs and calling backward
#
# **Still Left:**
#   -  Computing the loss
#   -  Updating the weights of the network
#
# Loss Function
# -------------
# A loss function takes the (output, target) pair of inputs, and computes a
# value that estimates how far away the output is from the target.
#
# There are several different
# `loss functions <https://pytorch.org/docs/nn.html#loss-functions>`_ under the
# nn package .
# A simple loss is: ``nn.MSELoss`` which computes the mean-squared error
# between the output and the target.
#
# For example:

output = net(input)
target = torch.randn(10)  # a dummy target, for example
target = target.view(1, -1)  # make it the same shape as output
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

loss = criterion(output, target)
print(loss)

########################################################################
# Now, if you follow ``loss`` in the backward direction, using its
# ``.grad_fn`` attribute, you will see a graph of computations that looks
# like this:
#
# .. code-block:: sh
#
#     input -> conv2d -> relu -> maxpool2d -> conv2d -> relu -> maxpool2d
#           -> flatten -> linear -> relu -> linear -> relu -> linear
#           -> MSELoss
#           -> loss
#
# So, when we call ``loss.backward()``, the whole graph is differentiated
# w.r.t. the neural net parameters, and all Tensors in the graph that have
# ``requires_grad=True`` will have their ``.grad`` Tensor accumulated with the
# gradient.
#
# For illustration, let us follow a few steps backward:

print(loss.grad_fn)  # MSELoss
print(loss.grad_fn.next_functions[0][0])  # Linear
print(loss.grad_fn.next_functions[0][0].next_functions[0][0])  # ReLU

########################################################################
# Backprop
# --------
# To backpropagate the error all we have to do is to ``loss.backward()``.
# You need to clear the existing gradients though, else gradients will be
# accumulated to existing gradients.
#
#
# Now we shall call ``loss.backward()``, and have a look at conv1's bias
# gradients before and after the backward.


net.zero_grad()     # zeroes the gradient buffers of all parameters

print('conv1.bias.grad before backward')
print(net.conv1.bias.grad)

loss.backward()

print('conv1.bias.grad after backward')
print(net.conv1.bias.grad)

########################################################################
# Now, we have seen how to use loss functions.
#
# **Read Later:**
#
#   The neural network package contains various modules and loss functions
#   that form the building blocks of deep neural networks. A full list with
#   documentation is `here <https://pytorch.org/docs/nn>`_.
#
# **The only thing left to learn is:**
#
#   - Updating the weights of the network
#
# Update the weights
# ------------------
# The simplest update rule used in practice is the Stochastic Gradient
# Descent (SGD):
#
# .. code:: python
#
#     weight = weight - learning_rate * gradient
#
# We can implement this using simple Python code:
#
# .. code:: python
#
#     learning_rate = 0.01
#     for f in net.parameters():
#         f.data.sub_(f.grad.data * learning_rate)
#
# However, as you use neural networks, you want to use various different
# update rules such as SGD, Nesterov-SGD, Adam, RMSProp, etc.
# To enable this, we built a small package: ``torch.optim`` that
# implements all these methods. Using it is very simple:
#
# .. code:: python
#
#     import torch.optim as optim
#
#     # create your optimizer
#     optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.01)
#
#     # in your training loop:
#     optimizer.zero_grad()   # zero the gradient buffers
#     output = net(input)
#     loss = criterion(output, target)
#     loss.backward()
#     optimizer.step()    # Does the update
#


###############################################################
# .. note::
#
#       Observe how gradient buffers had to be manually set to zero using
#       ``optimizer.zero_grad()``. This is because gradients are accumulated
#       as explained in the `Backprop`_ section.

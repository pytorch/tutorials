# Introduction
# ------------
# 
# This tutorial will give an introduction to DCGANs through an example. We
# will train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate new
# celebrities after showing it pictures of many real celebrities. Most of
# the code here is from the DCGAN implementation in
# `pytorch/examples <https://github.com/pytorch/examples>`__, and this
# document will give a thorough explanation of the implementation and shed
# light on how and why this model works. But don’t worry, no prior
# knowledge of GANs is required, but it may require a first-timer to spend
# some time reasoning about what is actually happening under the hood.
# Also, for the sake of time it will help to have a GPU, or two. Lets
# start from the beginning.
# 
# Generative Adversarial Networks
# -------------------------------
# 
# What is a GAN?
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# GANs are a framework for teaching a deep learning model to capture the training
# data distribution so we can generate new data from that same
# distribution. GANs were invented by Ian Goodfellow in 2014 and first
# described in the paper `Generative Adversarial
# Nets <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf>`__.
# They are made of two distinct models, a *generator* and a
# *discriminator*. The job of the generator is to spawn ‘fake’ images that
# look like the training images. The job of the discriminator is to look
# at an image and output whether or not it is a real training image or a
# fake image from the generator. During training, the generator is
# constantly trying to outsmart the discriminator by generating better and
# better fakes, while the discriminator is working to become a better
# detective and correctly classify the real and fake images. The
# equilibrium of this game is when the generator is generating perfect
# fakes that look as if they came directly from the training data, and the
# discriminator is left to always guess at 50% confidence that the
# generator output is real or fake.
# 
# Now, lets define some notation to be used throughout tutorial starting
# with the discriminator. Let :math:`x` be data representing an image.
# :math:`D(x)` is the discriminator network which outputs the (scalar)
# probability that :math:`x` came from training data rather than the
# generator. Here, since we are dealing with images, the input to
# :math:`D(x)` is an image of CHW size 3x64x64. Intuitively, :math:`D(x)`
# should be HIGH when :math:`x` comes from training data and LOW when
# :math:`x` comes from the generator. :math:`D(x)` can also be thought of
# as a traditional binary classifier.
# 
# For the generator’s notation, let :math:`z` be a latent space vector
# sampled from a standard normal distribution. :math:`G(z)` represents the
# generator function which maps the latent vector :math:`z` to data-space.
# The goal of :math:`G` is to estimate the distribution that the training
# data comes from (:math:`p_{data}`) so it can generate fake samples from
# that estimated distribution (:math:`p_g`).
# 
# So, :math:`D(G(z))` is the probability (scalar) that the output of the
# generator :math:`G` is a real image. As described in `Goodfellow’s
# paper <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf>`__,
# :math:`D` and :math:`G` play a minimax game in which :math:`D` tries to
# maximize the probability it correctly classifies reals and fakes
# (:math:`logD(x)`), and :math:`G` tries to minimize the probability that
# :math:`D` will predict its outputs are fake (:math:`log(1-D(G(z)))`).
# From the paper, the GAN loss function is
# 
# .. math:: \underset{G}{\text{min}} \underset{D}{\text{max}}V(D,G) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{data}(x)}\big[logD(x)\big] + \mathbb{E}_{z\sim p_{z}(z)}\big[log(1-D(G(z)))\big]
# 
# In theory, the solution to this minimax game is where
# :math:`p_g = p_{data}`, and the discriminator guesses randomly if the
# inputs are real or fake. However, the convergence theory of GANs is
# still being actively researched and in reality models do not always
# train to this point.
# 
# What is a DCGAN?
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# A DCGAN is a direct extension of the GAN described above, except that it
# explicitly uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers in the
# discriminator and generator, respectively. It was first described by
# Radford et. al. in the paper `Unsupervised Representation Learning With
# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial
# Networks <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf>`__. The discriminator
# is made up of strided
# `convolution <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Conv2d>`__
# layers, `batch
# norm <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.BatchNorm2d>`__
# layers, and
# `LeakyReLU <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.LeakyReLU>`__
# activations. The input is a 3x64x64 input image and the output is a
# scalar probability that the input is from the real data distribution.
# The generator is comprised of
# `convolutional-transpose <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d>`__
# layers, batch norm layers, and
# `ReLU <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#relu>`__ activations. The
# input is a latent vector, :math:`z`, that is drawn from a standard
# normal distribution and the output is a 3x64x64 RGB image. The strided
# conv-transpose layers allow the latent vector to be transformed into a
# volume with the same shape as an image. In the paper, the authors also
# give some tips about how to setup the optimizers, how to calculate the
# loss functions, and how to initialize the model weights, all of which
# will be explained in the coming sections.

# Inputs
# ------
# 
# Let’s define some inputs for the run:
# 
# -  ``dataroot`` - the path to the root of the dataset folder. We will
#    talk more about the dataset in the next section.
# -  ``workers`` - the number of worker threads for loading the data with
#    the ``DataLoader``.
# -  ``batch_size`` - the batch size used in training. The DCGAN paper
#    uses a batch size of 128.
# -  ``image_size`` - the spatial size of the images used for training.
#    This implementation defaults to 64x64. If another size is desired,
#    the structures of D and G must be changed. See
#    `here <https://github.com/pytorch/examples/issues/70>`__ for more
#    details.
# -  ``nc`` - number of color channels in the input images. For color
#    images this is 3.
# -  ``nz`` - length of latent vector.
# -  ``ngf`` - relates to the depth of feature maps carried through the
#    generator.
# -  ``ndf`` - sets the depth of feature maps propagated through the
#    discriminator.
# -  ``num_epochs`` - number of training epochs to run. Training for
#    longer will probably lead to better results but will also take much
#    longer.
# -  ``lr`` - learning rate for training. As described in the DCGAN paper,
#    this number should be 0.0002.
# -  ``beta1`` - beta1 hyperparameter for Adam optimizers. As described in
#    paper, this number should be 0.5.
# -  ``ngpu`` - number of GPUs available. If this is 0, code will run in
#    CPU mode. If this number is greater than 0 it will run on that number
#    of GPUs.

# Data
# ----
# 
# In this tutorial we will use the `Celeb-A Faces
# dataset <http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html>`__ which can
# be downloaded at the linked site, or in `Google
# Drive <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7EVK8r0v71pTUZsaXdaSnZBZzg>`__.
# The dataset will download as a file named ``img_align_celeba.zip``. Once
# downloaded, create a directory named ``celeba`` and extract the zip file
# into that directory. Then, set the ``dataroot`` input for this notebook to
# the ``celeba`` directory you just created. The resulting directory
# structure should be:
# 
# .. code-block:: sh
# 
#    /path/to/celeba
#        -> img_align_celeba  
#            -> 188242.jpg
#            -> 173822.jpg
#            -> 284702.jpg
#            -> 537394.jpg
#               ...
# 
# This is an important step because we will be using the ``ImageFolder``
# dataset class, which requires there to be subdirectories in the
# dataset root folder. Now, we can create the dataset, create the
# dataloader, set the device to run on, and finally visualize some of the
# training data.
# 

# We can use an image folder dataset the way we have it setup.
# Create the dataset

                               transforms.CenterCrop(image_size),
                               transforms.ToTensor(),
                               transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)),
                           ]))
# Create the dataloader
dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size,
                                         shuffle=True, num_workers=workers)

# Decide which device we want to run on
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if (torch.cuda.is_available() and ngpu > 0) else "cpu")

# Implementation
# --------------
# 
# With our input parameters set and the dataset prepared, we can now get
# into the implementation. We will start with the weight initialization
# strategy, then talk about the generator, discriminator, loss functions,
# and training loop in detail.
# 
# Weight Initialization
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# From the DCGAN paper, the authors specify that all model weights shall
# be randomly initialized from a Normal distribution with ``mean=0``,
# ``stdev=0.02``. The ``weights_init`` function takes an initialized model as
# input and reinitializes all convolutional, convolutional-transpose, and
# batch normalization layers to meet this criteria. This function is
# applied to the models immediately after initialization.
# 

# custom weights initialization called on ``netG`` and ``netD``
def weights_init(m):
    classname = m.__class__.__name__
    if classname.find('Conv') != -1:
        nn.init.normal_(m.weight.data, 0.0, 0.02)
    elif classname.find('BatchNorm') != -1:
        nn.init.normal_(m.weight.data, 1.0, 0.02)
        nn.init.constant_(m.bias.data, 0)

# Generator
# ~~~~~~~~~
# 
# The generator, :math:`G`, is designed to map the latent space vector
# (:math:`z`) to data-space. Since our data are images, converting
# :math:`z` to data-space means ultimately creating a RGB image with the
# same size as the training images (i.e. 3x64x64). In practice, this is
# accomplished through a series of strided two dimensional convolutional
# transpose layers, each paired with a 2d batch norm layer and a relu
# activation. The output of the generator is fed through a tanh function
# to return it to the input data range of :math:`[-1,1]`. It is worth
# noting the existence of the batch norm functions after the
# conv-transpose layers, as this is a critical contribution of the DCGAN
# paper. These layers help with the flow of gradients during training. An
# image of the generator from the DCGAN paper is shown below.
#
# .. figure:: /_static/img/dcgan_generator.png
#    :alt: dcgan_generator
#
# Notice, how the inputs we set in the input section (``nz``, ``ngf``, and
# ``nc``) influence the generator architecture in code. ``nz`` is the length
# of the z input vector, ``ngf`` relates to the size of the feature maps
# that are propagated through the generator, and ``nc`` is the number of
# channels in the output image (set to 3 for RGB images). Below is the
# code for the generator.

# Discriminator
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# As mentioned, the discriminator, :math:`D`, is a binary classification
# network that takes an image as input and outputs a scalar probability
# that the input image is real (as opposed to fake). Here, :math:`D` takes
# a 3x64x64 input image, processes it through a series of Conv2d,
# BatchNorm2d, and LeakyReLU layers, and outputs the final probability
# through a Sigmoid activation function. This architecture can be extended
# with more layers if necessary for the problem, but there is significance
# to the use of the strided convolution, BatchNorm, and LeakyReLUs. The
# DCGAN paper mentions it is a good practice to use strided convolution
# rather than pooling to downsample because it lets the network learn its
# own pooling function. Also batch norm and leaky relu functions promote
# healthy gradient flow which is critical for the learning process of both
# :math:`G` and :math:`D`.

# Loss Functions and Optimizers
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# With :math:`D` and :math:`G` setup, we can specify how they learn
# through the loss functions and optimizers. We will use the Binary Cross
# Entropy loss
# (`BCELoss <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BCELoss.html#torch.nn.BCELoss>`__)
# function which is defined in PyTorch as:
# 
# .. math:: \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad l_n = - \left[ y_n \cdot \log x_n + (1 - y_n) \cdot \log (1 - x_n) \right]
# 
# Notice how this function provides the calculation of both log components
# in the objective function (i.e. :math:`log(D(x))` and
# :math:`log(1-D(G(z)))`). We can specify what part of the BCE equation to
# use with the :math:`y` input. This is accomplished in the training loop
# which is coming up soon, but it is important to understand how we can
# choose which component we wish to calculate just by changing :math:`y`
# (i.e. GT labels).
# 
# Next, we define our real label as 1 and the fake label as 0. These
# labels will be used when calculating the losses of :math:`D` and
# :math:`G`, and this is also the convention used in the original GAN
# paper. Finally, we set up two separate optimizers, one for :math:`D` and
# one for :math:`G`. As specified in the DCGAN paper, both are Adam
# optimizers with learning rate 0.0002 and Beta1 = 0.5. For keeping track
# of the generator’s learning progression, we will generate a fixed batch
# of latent vectors that are drawn from a Gaussian distribution
# (i.e. fixed_noise) . In the training loop, we will periodically input
# this fixed_noise into :math:`G`, and over the iterations we will see
# images form out of the noise.
# 

# Initialize the ``BCELoss`` function
criterion = nn.BCELoss()

# Create batch of latent vectors that we will use to visualize
#  the progression of the generator
fixed_noise = torch.randn(64, nz, 1, 1, device=device)

# Establish convention for real and fake labels during training
real_label = 1.
fake_label = 0.

# Setup Adam optimizers for both G and D
optimizerD = optim.Adam(netD.parameters(), lr=lr, betas=(beta1, 0.999))
optimizerG = optim.Adam(netG.parameters(), lr=lr, betas=(beta1, 0.999))


######################################################################
# Training
# ~~~~~~~~
# 
# Finally, now that we have all of the parts of the GAN framework defined,
# we can train it. Be mindful that training GANs is somewhat of an art
# form, as incorrect hyperparameter settings lead to mode collapse with
# little explanation of what went wrong. Here, we will closely follow
# Algorithm 1 from the `Goodfellow’s paper <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf>`__, 
# while abiding by some of the best
# practices shown in `ganhacks <https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks>`__.
# Namely, we will “construct different mini-batches for real and fake”
# images, and also adjust G’s objective function to maximize
# :math:`log(D(G(z)))`. Training is split up into two main parts. Part 1
# updates the Discriminator and Part 2 updates the Generator.
# 
# **Part 1 - Train the Discriminator**
# 
# Recall, the goal of training the discriminator is to maximize the
# probability of correctly classifying a given input as real or fake. In
# terms of Goodfellow, we wish to “update the discriminator by ascending
# its stochastic gradient”. Practically, we want to maximize
# :math:`log(D(x)) + log(1-D(G(z)))`. Due to the separate mini-batch
# suggestion from `ganhacks <https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks>`__,
# we will calculate this in two steps. First, we
# will construct a batch of real samples from the training set, forward
# pass through :math:`D`, calculate the loss (:math:`log(D(x))`), then
# calculate the gradients in a backward pass. Secondly, we will construct
# a batch of fake samples with the current generator, forward pass this
# batch through :math:`D`, calculate the loss (:math:`log(1-D(G(z)))`),
# and *accumulate* the gradients with a backward pass. Now, with the
# gradients accumulated from both the all-real and all-fake batches, we
# call a step of the Discriminator’s optimizer.
# 
# **Part 2 - Train the Generator**
# 
# As stated in the original paper, we want to train the Generator by
# minimizing :math:`log(1-D(G(z)))` in an effort to generate better fakes.
# As mentioned, this was shown by Goodfellow to not provide sufficient
# gradients, especially early in the learning process. As a fix, we
# instead wish to maximize :math:`log(D(G(z)))`. In the code we accomplish
# this by: classifying the Generator output from Part 1 with the
# Discriminator, computing G’s loss *using real labels as GT*, computing
# G’s gradients in a backward pass, and finally updating G’s parameters
# with an optimizer step. It may seem counter-intuitive to use the real
# labels as GT labels for the loss function, but this allows us to use the
# :math:`log(x)` part of the ``BCELoss`` (rather than the :math:`log(1-x)`
# part) which is exactly what we want.
# 
# Finally, we will do some statistic reporting and at the end of each
# epoch we will push our fixed_noise batch through the generator to
# visually track the progress of G’s training. The training statistics
# reported are:
# 
# -  **Loss_D** - discriminator loss calculated as the sum of losses for
#    the all real and all fake batches (:math:`log(D(x)) + log(1 - D(G(z)))`).
# -  **Loss_G** - generator loss calculated as :math:`log(D(G(z)))`
# -  **D(x)** - the average output (across the batch) of the discriminator
#    for the all real batch. This should start close to 1 then
#    theoretically converge to 0.5 when G gets better. Think about why
#    this is.

# Results
# -------
# 
# Finally, lets check out how we did. Here, we will look at three
# different results. First, we will see how D and G’s losses changed
# during training. Second, we will visualize G’s output on the fixed_noise
# batch for every epoch. And third, we will look at a batch of real data
# next to a batch of fake data from G.
# 
# **Loss versus training iteration**
# 
# Below is a plot of D & G’s losses versus training iterations.

# after every epoch of training. Now, we can visualize the training
# progression of G with an animation. Press the play button to start the

# Where to Go Next
# ----------------
# 
# We have reached the end of our journey, but there are several places you
# could go from here. You could:
# 
# -  Train for longer to see how good the results get
# -  Modify this model to take a different dataset and possibly change the
#    size of the images and the model architecture
# -  Check out some other cool GAN projects
#    `here <https://github.com/nashory/gans-awesome-applications>`__
# -  Create GANs that generate

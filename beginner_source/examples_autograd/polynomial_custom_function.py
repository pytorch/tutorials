PyTorch: Defining New autograd Functions
----------------------------------------

A third order polynomial, trained to predict :math:`y=\sin(x)` from :math:`-\pi`
to :math:`\pi` by minimizing squared Euclidean distance. Instead of writing the
polynomial as :math:`y=a+bx+cx^2+dx^3`, we write the polynomial as
:math:`y=a+b P_3(c+dx)` where :math:`P_3(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(5x^3-3x\\right)` is
the `Legendre polynomial`_ of degree three.

.. _Legendre polynomial:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials

This implementation computes the forward pass using operations on PyTorch
Tensors, and uses PyTorch autograd to compute gradients.

In this implementation we implement our own custom autograd function to perform
:math:`P_3'(x)`. By mathematics, :math:`P_3'(x)=\\frac{3}{2}\\left(5x^2-1\\right)`

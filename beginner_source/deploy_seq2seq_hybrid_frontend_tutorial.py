######################################################################
# This tutorial will walk through the process of transitioning a
# sequence-to-sequence model to TorchScript using the TorchScript
# API. The model that we will convert is the chatbot model from the
# `Chatbot tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/chatbot_tutorial.html>`__.
# You can either treat this tutorial as a “Part 2” to the Chatbot tutorial
# and deploy your own pretrained model, or you can start with this
# document and use a pretrained model that we host. In the latter case,
# you can reference the original Chatbot tutorial for details
# regarding data preprocessing, model theory and definition, and model
# training.
#
# What is TorchScript?
# ----------------------------
#
# During the research and development phase of a deep learning-based
# project, it is advantageous to interact with an **eager**, imperative
# interface like PyTorch’s. This gives users the ability to write
# familiar, idiomatic Python, allowing for the use of Python data
# structures, control flow operations, print statements, and debugging
# utilities. Although the eager interface is a beneficial tool for
# research and experimentation applications, when it comes time to deploy
# the model in a production environment, having a **graph**-based model
# representation is very beneficial. A deferred graph representation
# allows for optimizations such as out-of-order execution, and the ability
# to target highly optimized hardware architectures. Also, a graph-based
# representation enables framework-agnostic model exportation. PyTorch
# provides mechanisms for incrementally converting eager-mode code into
# TorchScript, a statically analyzable and optimizable subset of Python
# that Torch uses to represent deep learning programs independently from
# the Python runtime.
#
# The API for converting eager-mode PyTorch programs into TorchScript is
# found in the ``torch.jit`` module. This module has two core modalities for
# converting an eager-mode model to a TorchScript graph representation:
# **tracing** and **scripting**. The ``torch.jit.trace`` function takes a
# module or function and a set of example inputs. It then runs the example
# input through the function or module while tracing the computational
# steps that are encountered, and outputs a graph-based function that
# performs the traced operations. **Tracing** is great for straightforward
# modules and functions that do not involve data-dependent control flow,
# such as standard convolutional neural networks. However, if a function
# with data-dependent if statements and loops is traced, only the
# operations called along the execution route taken by the example input
# will be recorded. In other words, the control flow itself is not
# captured. To convert modules and functions containing data-dependent
# control flow, a **scripting** mechanism is provided. The
# ``torch.jit.script`` function/decorator takes a module or function and
# does not requires example inputs. Scripting then explicitly converts
# the module or function code to TorchScript, including all control flows.
# One caveat with using scripting is that it only supports a subset of
# Python, so you might need to rewrite the code to make it compatible
# with the TorchScript syntax.
#
# For all details relating to the supported features, see the `TorchScript
# language reference <https://pytorch.org/docs/master/jit.html>`__.
# To provide the maximum flexibility, you can also mix tracing and scripting
# modes together to represent your whole program, and these techniques can
# be applied incrementally.

# Prepare Environment
# -------------------
#
# First, we will import the required modules and set some constants. If
# you are planning on using your own model, be sure that the
# ``MAX_LENGTH`` constant is set correctly. As a reminder, this constant
# defines the maximum allowed sentence length during training and the
# maximum length output that the model is capable of producing.

MAX_LENGTH = 10  # Maximum sentence length

# Default word tokens

# Model Overview
# --------------
#
# As mentioned, the model that we are using is a
# `sequence-to-sequence <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__ (seq2seq)
# model. This type of model is used in cases when our input is a
# variable-length sequence, and our output is also a variable length
# sequence that is not necessarily a one-to-one mapping of the input. A
# seq2seq model is comprised of two recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that
# work cooperatively: an **encoder** and a **decoder**.

#
# Encoder
# ~~~~~~~
#
# The encoder RNN iterates through the input sentence one token
# (e.g. word) at a time, at each time step outputting an “output” vector
# and a “hidden state” vector. The hidden state vector is then passed to
# the next time step, while the output vector is recorded. The encoder
# transforms the context it saw at each point in the sequence into a set
# of points in a high-dimensional space, which the decoder will use to
# generate a meaningful output for the given task.
#
# Decoder
# ~~~~~~~
#
# The decoder RNN generates the response sentence in a token-by-token
# fashion. It uses the encoder’s context vectors, and internal hidden
# states to generate the next word in the sequence. It continues
# generating words until it outputs an *EOS_token*, representing the end
# of the sentence. We use an `attention
# mechanism <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`__ in our decoder to help it
# to “pay attention” to certain parts of the input when generating the
# output. For our model, we implement `Luong et
# al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025>`__\ ’s “Global attention” module,
# and use it as a submodule in our decode model.

# Data Handling
# -------------
#
# Although our models conceptually deal with sequences of tokens, in
# reality, they deal with numbers like all machine learning models do. In
# this case, every word in the model’s vocabulary, which was established
# before training, is mapped to an integer index. We use a ``Voc`` object
# to contain the mappings from word to index, as well as the total number
# of words in the vocabulary. We will load the object later before we run
# the model.
#
# Also, in order for us to be able to run evaluations, we must provide a
# tool for processing our string inputs. The ``normalizeString`` function
# converts all characters in a string to lowercase and removes all
# non-letter characters. The ``indexesFromSentence`` function takes a
# sentence of words and returns the corresponding sequence of word
# indexes.
#

class Voc:

######################################################################
# Define Encoder
# --------------
#
# We implement our encoder’s RNN with the ``torch.nn.GRU`` module which we
# feed a batch of sentences (vectors of word embeddings) and it internally
# iterates through the sentences one token at a time calculating the
# hidden states. We initialize this module to be bidirectional, meaning
# that we have two independent GRUs: one that iterates through the
# sequences in chronological order, and another that iterates in reverse
# order. We ultimately return the sum of these two GRUs’ outputs. Since
# our model was trained using batching, our ``EncoderRNN`` model’s
# ``forward`` function expects a padded input batch. To batch
# variable-length sentences, we allow a maximum of *MAX_LENGTH* tokens in
# a sentence, and all sentences in the batch that have less than
# *MAX_LENGTH* tokens are padded at the end with our dedicated *PAD_token*
# tokens. To use padded batches with a PyTorch RNN module, we must wrap
# the forward pass call with ``torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence``
# and ``torch.nn.utils.rnn.pad_packed_sequence`` data transformations.
# Note that the ``forward`` function also takes an ``input_lengths`` list,
# which contains the length of each sentence in the batch. This input is
# used by the ``torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence`` function when
# padding.
#
# TorchScript Notes:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Since the encoder’s ``forward`` function does not contain any
# data-dependent control flow, we will use **tracing** to convert it to
# script mode. When tracing a module, we can leave the module definition
# as-is. We will initialize all models towards the end of this document
# before we run evaluations.

# Define Decoder’s Attention Module

#
# Next, we’ll define our attention module (``Attn``). Note that this

# RNN output and the entire encoder output, and return attention
# “energies”. This attention energies tensor is the same size as the
# encoder output, and the two are ultimately multiplied, resulting in a
# weighted tensor whose largest values represent the most important parts
# of the query sentence at a particular time-step of decoding.

######################################################################
# Define Decoder
# --------------
#
# Similarly to the ``EncoderRNN``, we use the ``torch.nn.GRU`` module for
# our decoder’s RNN. This time, however, we use a unidirectional GRU. It
# is important to note that unlike the encoder, we will feed the decoder
# RNN one word at a time. We start by getting the embedding of the current
# word and applying a
# `dropout <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html?highlight=dropout#torch.nn.Dropout>`__.
# Next, we forward the embedding and the last hidden state to the GRU and
# obtain a current GRU output and hidden state. We then use our ``Attn``
# module as a layer to obtain the attention weights, which we multiply by
# the encoder’s output to obtain our attended encoder output. We use this
# attended encoder output as our ``context`` tensor, which represents a
# weighted sum indicating what parts of the encoder’s output to pay
# attention to. From here, we use a linear layer and softmax normalization
# to select the next word in the output sequence.

# TorchScript Notes:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Similarly to the ``EncoderRNN``, this module does not contain any
# data-dependent control flow. Therefore, we can once again use
# **tracing** to convert this model to TorchScript after it
# is initialized and its parameters are loaded.

######################################################################
# Define Evaluation
# -----------------
#
# Greedy Search Decoder
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# As in the chatbot tutorial, we use a ``GreedySearchDecoder`` module to
# facilitate the actual decoding process. This module has the trained
# encoder and decoder models as attributes, and drives the process of
# encoding an input sentence (a vector of word indexes), and iteratively
# decoding an output response sequence one word (word index) at a time.
#
# Encoding the input sequence is straightforward: simply forward the
# entire sequence tensor and its corresponding lengths vector to the
# ``encoder``. It is important to note that this module only deals with
# one input sequence at a time, **NOT** batches of sequences. Therefore,
# when the constant **1** is used for declaring tensor sizes, this
# corresponds to a batch size of 1. To decode a given decoder output, we
# must iteratively run forward passes through our decoder model, which
# outputs softmax scores corresponding to the probability of each word
# being the correct next word in the decoded sequence. We initialize the
# ``decoder_input`` to a tensor containing an *SOS_token*. After each pass
# through the ``decoder``, we *greedily* append the word with the highest
# softmax probability to the ``decoded_words`` list. We also use this word
# as the ``decoder_input`` for the next iteration. The decoding process
# terminates either if the ``decoded_words`` list has reached a length of
# *MAX_LENGTH* or if the predicted word is the *EOS_token*.
#
# TorchScript Notes:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The ``forward`` method of this module involves iterating over the range
# of :math:`[0, max\_length)` when decoding an output sequence one word at
# a time. Because of this, we should use **scripting** to convert this
# module to TorchScript. Unlike with our encoder and decoder models,
# which we can trace, we must make some necessary changes to the
# ``GreedySearchDecoder`` module in order to initialize an object without
# error. In other words, we must ensure that our module adheres to the
# rules of the TorchScript mechanism, and does not utilize any language
# features outside of the subset of Python that TorchScript includes.
#
# To get an idea of some manipulations that may be required, we will go
# over the diffs between the ``GreedySearchDecoder`` implementation from
# the chatbot tutorial and the implementation that we use in the cell
# below. Note that the lines highlighted in red are lines removed from the
# original implementation and the lines highlighted in green are new.
#
# .. figure:: /_static/img/chatbot/diff.png
#    :align: center
#    :alt: diff
#
# Changes:
# ^^^^^^^^
#
# -  Added ``decoder_n_layers`` to the constructor arguments
#
#    -  This change stems from the fact that the encoder and decoder
#       models that we pass to this module will be a child of
#       ``TracedModule`` (not ``Module``). Therefore, we cannot access the
#       decoder’s number of layers with ``decoder.n_layers``. Instead, we
#       plan for this, and pass this value in during module construction.
#
#
# -  Store away new attributes as constants
#
#    -  In the original implementation, we were free to use variables from
#       the surrounding (global) scope in our ``GreedySearchDecoder``\ ’s
#       ``forward`` method. However, now that we are using scripting, we
#       do not have this freedom, as the assumption with scripting is that
#       we cannot necessarily hold on to Python objects, especially when
#       exporting. An easy solution to this is to store these values from
#       the global scope as attributes to the module in the constructor,
#       and add them to a special list called ``__constants__`` so that
#       they can be used as literal values when constructing the graph in
#       the ``forward`` method. An example of this usage is on NEW line
#       19, where instead of using the ``device`` and ``SOS_token`` global
#       values, we use our constant attributes ``self._device`` and
#       ``self._SOS_token``.
#
#
# -  Enforce types of ``forward`` method arguments
#
#    -  By default, all parameters to a TorchScript function are assumed
#       to be Tensor. If we need to pass an argument of a different type,
#       we can use function type annotations as introduced in `PEP
#       3107 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/>`__. In addition,
#       it is possible to declare arguments of different types using
#       Mypy-style type annotations (see
#       `doc <https://pytorch.org/docs/master/jit.html#types>`__).
#
#
# -  Change initialization of ``decoder_input``
#
#    -  In the original implementation, we initialized our
#       ``decoder_input`` tensor with ``torch.LongTensor([[SOS_token]])``.
#       When scripting, we are not allowed to initialize tensors in a
#       literal fashion like this. Instead, we can initialize our tensor
#       with an explicit torch function such as ``torch.ones``. In this
#       case, we can easily replicate the scalar ``decoder_input`` tensor
#       by multiplying 1 by our SOS_token value stored in the constant
#       ``self._SOS_token``.

# Evaluating an Input
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Next, we define some functions for evaluating an input. The ``evaluate``
# function takes a normalized string sentence, processes it to a tensor of
# its corresponding word indexes (with batch size of 1), and passes this
# tensor to a ``GreedySearchDecoder`` instance called ``searcher`` to
# handle the encoding/decoding process. The searcher returns the output
# word index vector and a scores tensor corresponding to the softmax
# scores for each decoded word token. The final step is to convert each
# word index back to its string representation using ``voc.index2word``.
#
# We also define two functions for evaluating an input sentence. The
# ``evaluateInput`` function prompts a user for an input, and evaluates
# it. It will continue to ask for another input until the user enters ‘q’
# or ‘quit’.
#
# The ``evaluateExample`` function simply takes a string input sentence as
# an argument, normalizes it, evaluates it, and prints the response.
#

# Load Pretrained Parameters
# --------------------------
#
# No, let's load our model!
#
# Use hosted model
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# To load the hosted model:
#
# 1) Download the model `here <https://download.pytorch.org/models/tutorials/4000_checkpoint.tar>`__.
#
# 2) Set the ``loadFilename`` variable to the path to the downloaded
#    checkpoint file.
#
# 3) Leave the ``checkpoint = torch.load(loadFilename)`` line uncommented,
#    as the hosted model was trained on CPU.
#
# Use your own model
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# To load your own pretrained model:
#
# 1) Set the ``loadFilename`` variable to the path to the checkpoint file
#    that you wish to load. Note that if you followed the convention for
#    saving the model from the chatbot tutorial, this may involve changing
#    the ``model_name``, ``encoder_n_layers``, ``decoder_n_layers``,
#    ``hidden_size``, and ``checkpoint_iter`` (as these values are used in
#    the model path).
#
# 2) If you trained the model on a CPU, make sure that you are opening the
#    checkpoint with the ``checkpoint = torch.load(loadFilename)`` line.
#    If you trained the model on a GPU and are running this tutorial on a
#    CPU, uncomment the
#    ``checkpoint = torch.load(loadFilename, map_location=torch.device('cpu'))``
#    line.
#
# TorchScript Notes:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Notice that we initialize and load parameters into our encoder and
# decoder models as usual. If you are using tracing mode(``torch.jit.trace``)
# for some part of your models, you must call ``.to(device)`` to set the device
# options of the models and ``.eval()`` to set the dropout layers to test mode
# **before** tracing the models. `TracedModule` objects do not inherit the
# ``to`` or ``eval`` methods. Since in this tutorial we are only using
# scripting instead of tracing, we only need to do this before we do
# evaluation (which is the same as we normally do in eager mode).

# Convert Model to TorchScript
# -----------------------------
#
# Encoder
# ~~~~~~~
#
# As previously mentioned, to convert the encoder model to TorchScript,
# we use **scripting**. The encoder model takes an input sequence and
# a corresponding lengths tensor. Therefore, we create an example input
# sequence tensor ``test_seq``, which is of appropriate size (MAX_LENGTH,
# 1), contains numbers in the appropriate range
# :math:`[0, voc.num\_words)`, and is of the appropriate type (int64). We
# also create a ``test_seq_length`` scalar which realistically contains
# the value corresponding to how many words are in the ``test_seq``. The
# next step is to use the ``torch.jit.trace`` function to trace the model.
# Notice that the first argument we pass is the module that we want to
# trace, and the second is a tuple of arguments to the module’s
# ``forward`` method.
#
# Decoder
# ~~~~~~~
#
# We perform the same process for tracing the decoder as we did for the
# encoder. Notice that we call forward on a set of random inputs to the
# traced_encoder to get the output that we need for the decoder. This is
# not required, as we could also simply manufacture a tensor of the
# correct shape, type, and value range. This method is possible because in
# our case we do not have any constraints on the values of the tensors
# because we do not have any operations that could fault on out-of-range
# inputs.
#
# GreedySearchDecoder
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Recall that we scripted our searcher module due to the presence of
# data-dependent control flow. In the case of scripting, we do necessary
# language changes to make sure the implementation complies with
# TorchScript. We initialize the scripted searcher the same way that we
# would initialize an unscripted variant.
#

### Compile the whole greedy search model to TorchScript model
# Create artificial inputs
test_seq = torch.LongTensor(MAX_LENGTH, 1).random_(0, voc.num_words).to(device)
test_seq_length = torch.LongTensor([test_seq.size()[0]]).to(device)
# Trace the model
traced_encoder = torch.jit.trace(encoder, (test_seq, test_seq_length))

### Convert decoder model
# Create and generate artificial inputs
test_encoder_outputs, test_encoder_hidden = traced_encoder(test_seq, test_seq_length)
test_decoder_hidden = test_encoder_hidden[:decoder.n_layers]
test_decoder_input = torch.LongTensor(1, 1).random_(0, voc.num_words)
# Trace the model
traced_decoder = torch.jit.trace(decoder, (test_decoder_input, test_decoder_hidden, test_encoder_outputs))

### Initialize searcher module by wrapping ``torch.jit.script`` call
scripted_searcher = torch.jit.script(GreedySearchDecoder(traced_encoder, traced_decoder, decoder.n_layers))




######################################################################
# Print Graphs
# ------------
#
# Now that our models are in TorchScript form, we can print the graphs of
# each to ensure that we captured the computational graph appropriately.
# Since TorchScript allow us to recursively compile the whole model
# hierarchy and inline the ``encoder`` and ``decoder`` graph into a single
# graph, we just need to print the `scripted_searcher` graph

print('scripted_searcher graph:\n', scripted_searcher.graph)


######################################################################
# Run Evaluation
# --------------
#
# Finally, we will run evaluation of the chatbot model using the TorchScript
# models. If converted correctly, the models will behave exactly as they
# would in their eager-mode representation.
#
# By default, we evaluate a few common query sentences. If you want to
# chat with the bot yourself, uncomment the ``evaluateInput`` line and
# give it a spin.
#


# Use appropriate device
scripted_searcher.to(device)
# Set dropout layers to ``eval`` mode
scripted_searcher.eval()

# Evaluate examples
sentences = ["hello", "what's up?", "who are you?", "where am I?", "where are you from?"]
for s in sentences:
    evaluateExample(s, scripted_searcher, voc)

# Evaluate your input by running
# ``evaluateInput(traced_encoder, traced_decoder, scripted_searcher, voc)``


######################################################################
# Save Model
# ----------
#
# Now that we have successfully converted our model to TorchScript, we
# will serialize it for use in a non-Python deployment environment. To do
# this, we can simply save our ``scripted_searcher`` module, as this is
# the user-facing interface for running inference against the chatbot
# model. When saving a Script module, use script_module.save(PATH) instead
# of torch.save(model, PATH).

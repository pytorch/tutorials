Most machine learning workflows involve working with data, creating models, optimizing model 
parameters, and saving the trained models. This tutorial introduces you to a complete ML workflow 
implemented in PyTorch, with links to learn more about each of these concepts.

We'll use the FashionMNIST dataset to train a neural network that predicts if an input image belongs 
to one of the following classes: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, 
Bag, or Ankle boot. 

`This tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with Python and Deep Learning concepts.`


Running the Tutorial Code
------------------
You can run this tutorial in a couple of ways:

- **In the cloud**: This is the easiest way to get started! Each section has a Colab link at the top, which opens a notebook with the code in a fully-hosted environment. Pro tip: Use Colab with a GPU runtime to speed up operations *Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU*
- **Locally**: This option requires you to setup PyTorch and TorchVision first on your local machine (`installation instructions <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_). Download the notebook or copy the code into your favorite IDE.


How to Use this Guide
----------------- 
If you're new to deep learning frameworks, head right into the first step of our guide: `Tensors <tensor_tutorial.html>`_.

If you're familiar with other deep learning frameworks, check out the `Quickstart <quickstart_tutorial.html>`_ first
to quickly familiarize yourself with PyTorch's API.

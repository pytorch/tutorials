This series of video tutorials walks you through distributed training in
PyTorch via DDP.

The series starts with a simple non-distributed training job, and ends
with deploying a training job across several machines in a cluster.
Along the way, you will also learn about
`torchrun <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/elastic/run.html>`__ for
fault-tolerant distributed training.

The tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with model training in PyTorch.

Running the code
----------------

You will need multiple CUDA GPUs to run the tutorial code. Typically,
this can be done on a cloud instance with multiple GPUs (the tutorials
use an Amazon EC2 P3 instance with 4 GPUs).

The tutorial code is hosted in this
`github repo <https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/main/distributed/ddp-tutorial-series>`__.
Clone the repository and follow along!

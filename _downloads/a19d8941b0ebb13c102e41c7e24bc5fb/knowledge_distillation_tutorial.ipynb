    "share the same number of output neurons. The method works by\n",

    "assumption is that the output activations of a properly trained teacher\n",

    "similarity structure over the data where similar objects are mapped\n",
    "closer together. For example, in CIFAR-10, a truck could be mistaken for\n",

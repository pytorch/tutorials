        "### Loading CIFAR-10\nCIFAR-10 is a popular image dataset with ten classes. Our objective is to predict one of the following classes for each input image.\n\n.. figure:: /../_static/img/cifar10.png \n   :align: center\n\n   Example of CIFAR-10 images\n\nThe input images are RGB, so they have 3 channels and are 32x32 pixels. Basically, each image is described by 3 x 32 x 32 = 3072 numbers ranging from 0 to 255.\nA common practice in neural networks is to normalize the input, which is done for multiple reasons,\nincluding avoiding saturation in commonly used activation functions and increasing numerical stability.\nOur normalization process consists of subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation along each channel.\nThe tensors \"mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]\" and \"std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]\" were already computed,\nand they represent the mean and standard deviation of each channel in the\npredefined subset of CIFAR-10 intended to be the training set.\nNotice how we use these values for the test set as well, without recomputing the mean and standard deviation from scratch.\nThis is because the network was trained on features produced by subtracting and dividing the numbers above, and we want to maintain consistency.\nFurthermore, in real life, we would not be able to compute the mean and standard deviation of the test set since,\nunder our assumptions, this data would not be accessible at that point.\n\nAs a closing point, we often refer to this held-out set as the validation set, and we use a separate set,\ncalled the test set, after optimizing a model's performance on the validation set.\nThis is done to avoid selecting a model based on the greedy and biased optimization of a single metric.\n\n"

        "### Knowledge distillation run\nNow let's try to improve the test accuracy of the student network by incorporating the teacher.\nKnowledge distillation is a straightforward technique to achieve this,\nbased on the fact that both networks output a probability distribution over our classes.\nTherefore, the two networks share the same number of output neurons.\nThe method works by incorporating an additional loss into the traditional cross entropy loss,\nwhich is based on the softmax output of the teacher network.\nThe assumption is that the output activations of a properly trained teacher network carry additional information that can be leveraged by a student network during training.\nThe original work suggests that utilizing ratios of smaller probabilities in the soft targets can help achieve the underlying objective of deep neural networks,\nwhich is to create a similarity structure over the data where similar objects are mapped closer together.\nFor example, in CIFAR-10, a truck could be mistaken for an automobile or airplane,\nif its wheels are present, but it is less likely to be mistaken for a dog. \nTherefore, it makes sense to assume that valuable information resides not only in the top prediction of a properly trained model but in the entire output distribution.\nHowever, cross entropy alone does not sufficiently exploit this information as the activations for non-predicted classes\ntend to be so small that propagated gradients do not meaningfully change the weights to construct this desirable vector space.\n\nAs we continue defining our first helper function that introduces a teacher-student dynamic, we need to include a few extra parameters:\n\n- ``T``: Temperature controls the smoothness of the output distributions. Larger ``T`` leads to smoother distributions, thus smaller probabilities get a larger boost.\n- ``soft_target_loss_weight``: A weight assigned to the extra objective we're about to include.\n- ``ce_loss_weight``: A weight assigned to cross-entropy. Tuning these weights pushes the network towards optimizing for either objective.\n\n.. figure:: /../_static/img/knowledge_distillation/distillation_output_loss.png \n   :align: center\n\n   Distillation loss is calculated from the logits of the networks.

        "### Cosine loss minimization run\nFeel free to play around with the temperature parameter that controls the softness of the softmax function and the loss coefficients.\nIn neural networks, it is easy to include to include additional loss functions to the main objectives to achieve goals like better generalization.\nLet's try including an objective for the student, but now let's focus on their hidden states rather than their output layers.\nOur goal is to convey information from the teacher's representation to the student by including a naive loss function,\nwhose minimization implies that the flattened vectors that are subsequently passed to the classifiers have become more *similar* as the loss decreases.\nOf course, the teacher does not update its weights, so the minimization depends only on the student's weights.\nThe rationale behind this method is that we are operating under the assumption that the teacher model has a better internal representation that is\nunlikely to be achieved by the student without external intervention, therefore we artificially push the student to mimic the internal representation of the teacher.\nWhether or not this will end up helping the student is not straightforward, though, because pushing the lightweight network\nto reach this point could be a good thing, assuming that we have found an internal representation that leads to better test accuracy,\nbut it could also be harmful because the networks have different architectures and the student does not have the same learning capacity as the teacher.\nIn other words, there is no reason for these two vectors, the student's and the teacher's to match per component.\nThe student could reach an internal representation that is a permutation of the teacher's and it would be just as efficient.\nNonetheless, we can still run a quick experiment to figure out the impact of this method.\nWe will be using the ``CosineEmbeddingLoss`` which is given by the following formula:\n\n.. figure:: /../_static/img/knowledge_distillation/cosine_embedding_loss.png \n   :align: center\n   :width: 450px\n\n   Formula for CosineEmbeddingLoss\n\nObviously, there is one thing that we need to resolve first.\nWhen we applied distillation to the output layer we mentioned that both networks have the same number of neurons, equal to the number of classes.\nHowever, this is not the case for the layer following our convolutional layers. Here, the teacher has more neurons than the student\nafter the flattening of the final convolutional layer. Our loss function accepts two vectors of equal dimensionality as inputs,\ntherefore we need to somehow match them. We will solve this by including an average pooling layer after the teacher's convolutional layer to reduce its dimensionality to match that of the student.\n\nTo proceed, we will modify our model classes, or create new ones.\nNow, the forward function returns not only the logits of the network but also the flattened hidden representation after the convolutional layer. We include the aforementioned pooling for the modified teacher.\n\n"

        "### Conclusion\nNone of the methods above increases the number of parameters for the network or inference time,\nso the performance increase comes at the little cost of calculating gradients during training.\nIn ML applications, we mostly care about inference time because training happens before the model deployment.\nIf our lightweight model is still too heavy for deployment, we can apply different ideas, such as post-training quantization.\nAdditional losses can be applied in many tasks, not just classification, and you can experiment with quantities like coefficients,\ntemperature, or number of neurons. Feel free to tune any numbers in the tutorial above,\nbut keep in mind, if you change the number of neurons / filters chances are a shape mismatch might occur.\n\nFor more information, see:\n\n* [Hinton, G., Vinyals, O., Dean, J.: Distilling the knowledge in a neural network.

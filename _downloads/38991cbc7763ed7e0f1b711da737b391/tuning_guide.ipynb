        "### Preallocate memory in case of variable input length\nModels for speech recognition or for NLP are often trained on input tensors\nwith variable sequence length. Variable length can be problematic for PyTorch\ncaching allocator and can lead to reduced performance or to unexpected\nout-of-memory errors. If a batch with a short sequence length is followed by\nan another batch with longer sequence length, then PyTorch is forced to\nrelease intermediate buffers from previous iteration and to re-allocate new\nbuffers. This process is time consuming and causes fragmentation in the\ncaching allocator which may result in out-of-memory errors.\n\nA typical solution is to implement preallocation. It consists of the\nfollowing steps:\n\n#. generate a (usually random) batch of inputs with maximum sequence length\n   (either corresponding to max length in the training dataset or to some\n   predefined threshold)\n#. execute a forward and a backward pass with the generated batch, do not\n   execute an optimizer or a learning rate scheduler, this step preallocates\n   buffers of maximum size, which can be reused in subsequent\n   training iterations\n#. zero out gradients\n#. proceed to regular training\n\n\n"

All-reduce for a particular bucket is asynchronously triggered\nonly when all gradients for parameters in a given bucket are available.\n\nTo maximize the amount of overlap, the order in model constructors should\nroughly match the order during the execution. If the order doesn't match, then\nall-reduce for the entire bucket waits for the gradient which is the last to\narrive, this may reduce the overlap between backward pass and all-reduce,\nall-reduce may end up being exposed, which slows down the training.\n\n``DistributedDataParallel`` with ``find_unused_parameters=False`` (which is\nthe default setting) relies on automatic bucket formation based on order of\noperations encountered during the backward pass.

        "### Load-balance workload in a distributed setting\nLoad imbalance typically may happen for models processing sequential data\n(speech recognition, translation, language models etc.). If one device\nreceives a batch of data with sequence length longer than sequence lengths for\nthe remaining devices, then all devices wait for the worker which finishes\nlast. Backward pass functions as an implicit synchronization point in a\ndistributed setting with\n[DistributedDataParallel](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html#torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel)\nbackend.\n\nThere are multiple ways to solve the load balancing problem. The core idea is\nto distribute workload over all workers as uniformly as possible within each\nglobal batch. For example Transformer solves imbalance by forming batches with\napproximately constant number of tokens (and variable number of sequences in a\nbatch), other models solve imbalance by bucketing samples with similar\nsequence length or even by sorting dataset by sequence length.\n\n"

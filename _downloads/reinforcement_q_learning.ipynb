        "\nReinforcement Learning (DQN) tutorial\n=====================================\n**Author**: `Adam Paszke <https://github.com/apaszke>`_\n\n\nThis tutorial shows how to use PyTorch to train a Deep Q Learning (DQN) agent\non the CartPole-v0 task from the `OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>`__.\n\n**Task**\n\nThe agent has to decide between two actions - moving the cart left or\nright - so that the pole attached to it stays upright. You can find an\nofficial leaderboard with various algorithms and visualizations at the\n`Gym website <https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0>`__.\n\n.. figure:: /_static/img/cartpole.gif\n   :alt: cartpole\n\n   cartpole\n\nAs the agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses\nan action, the environment *transitions* to a new state, and also\nreturns a reward that indicates the consequences of the action. In this\ntask, the environment terminates if the pole falls over too far.\n\nThe CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real\nvalues representing the environment state (position, velocity, etc.).\nHowever, neural networks can solve the task purely by looking at the\nscene, so we'll use a patch of the screen centered on the cart as an\ninput. Because of this, our results aren't directly comparable to the\nones from the official leaderboard - our task is much harder.\nUnfortunately this does slow down the training, because we have to\nrender all the frames.\n\nStrictly speaking, we will present the state as the difference between\nthe current screen patch and the previous one. This will allow the agent\nto take the velocity of the pole into account from one image.\n\n**Packages**\n\n\nFirst, let's import needed packages. Firstly, we need\n`gym <https://gym.openai.com/docs>`__ for the environment\n(Install using `pip install gym`).\nWe'll also use the following from PyTorch:\n\n-  neural networks (``torch.nn``)\n-  optimization (``torch.optim``)\n-  automatic differentiation (``torch.autograd``)\n-  utilities for vision tasks (``torchvision`` - `a separate\n   package <https://github.com/pytorch/vision>`__).\n\n\n"

        "Replay Memory\n-------------\n\nWe'll be using experience replay memory for training our DQN. It stores\nthe transitions that the agent observes, allowing us to reuse this data\nlater. By sampling from it randomly, the transitions that build up a\nbatch are decorrelated. It has been shown that this greatly stabilizes\nand improves the DQN training procedure.\n\nFor this, we're going to need two classses:\n\n-  ``Transition`` - a named tuple representing a single transition in\n   our environment\n-  ``ReplayMemory`` - a cyclic buffer of bounded size that holds the\n   transitions observed recently.

        "Now, let's define our model. But first, let quickly recap what a DQN is.\n\nDQN algorithm\n-------------\n\nOur environment is deterministic, so all equations presented here are\nalso formulated deterministically for the sake of simplicity. In the\nreinforcement learning literature, they would also contain expectations\nover stochastic transitions in the environment.\n\nOur aim will be to train a policy that tries to maximize the discounted,\ncumulative reward\n$R_{t_0} = \\sum_{t=t_0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^{t - t_0} r_t$, where\n$R_{t_0}$ is also known as the *return*. The discount,\n$\\gamma$, should be a constant between $0$ and $1$\nthat ensures the sum converges. It makes rewards from the uncertain far\nfuture less important for our agent than the ones in the near future\nthat it can be fairly confident about.\n\nThe main idea behind Q-learning is that if we had a function\n$Q^*: State \\times Action \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, that could tell\nus what our return would be, if we were to take an action in a given\nstate, then we could easily construct a policy that maximizes our\nrewards:\n\n\\begin{align}\\pi^*(s) = \\arg\\!\\max_a \\ Q^*(s, a)\\end{align}\n\nHowever, we don't know everything about the world, so we don't have\naccess to $Q^*$. But, since neural networks are universal function\napproximators, we can simply create one and train it to resemble\n$Q^*$.\n\nFor our training update rule, we'll use a fact that every $Q$\nfunction for some policy obeys the Bellman equation:\n\n\\begin{align}Q^{\\pi}(s, a) = r + \\gamma Q^{\\pi}(s', \\pi(s'))\\end{align}\n\nThe difference between the two sides of the equality is known as the\ntemporal difference error, $\\delta$:\n\n\\begin{align}\\delta = Q(s, a) - (r + \\gamma \\max_a Q(s', a))\\end{align}\n\nTo minimise this error, we will use the `Huber\nloss <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss>`__. The Huber loss acts\nlike the mean squared error when the error is small, but like the mean\nabsolute error when the error is large - this makes it more robust to\noutliers when the estimates of $Q$ are very noisy. We calculate\nthis over a batch of transitions, $B$, sampled from the replay\nmemory:\n\n\\begin{align}\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{|B|}\\sum_{(s, a, s', r) \\ \\in \\ B} \\mathcal{L}(\\delta)\\end{align}\n\n\\begin{align}\\text{where} \\quad \\mathcal{L}(\\delta) = \\begin{cases}\n     \\frac{1}{2}{\\delta^2}  & \\text{for } |\\delta| \\le 1, \\\\\n     |\\delta| - \\frac{1}{2} & \\text{otherwise.}\n   \\end{cases}\\end{align}\n\nQ-network\n^^^^^^^^^\n\nOur model will be a convolutional neural network that takes in the\ndifference between the current and previous screen patches. It has two\noutputs, representing $Q(s, \\mathrm{left})$ and\n$Q(s, \\mathrm{right})$ (where $s$ is the input to the\nnetwork). In effect, the network is trying to predict the *quality* of\ntaking each action given the current input.\n\n\n"

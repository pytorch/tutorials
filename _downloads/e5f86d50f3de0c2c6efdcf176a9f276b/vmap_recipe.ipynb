        "\n# torch.vmap\nThis tutorial introduces torch.vmap, an autovectorizer for PyTorch operations.\ntorch.vmap is a prototype feature and cannot handle a number of use cases;\nhowever, we would like to gather use cases for it to inform the design. If you\nare considering using torch.vmap or think it would be really cool for something,\nplease contact us at https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/42368.\n\n## So, what is vmap?\nvmap is a higher-order function. It accepts a function `func` and returns a new\nfunction that maps `func` over some dimension of the inputs. It is highly\ninspired by JAX's vmap.\n\nSemantically, vmap pushes the \"map\" into PyTorch operations called by `func`,\neffectively vectorizing those operations.\n"

One can write a function `func`\nthat runs on examples and then lift it to a function that can\ntake batches of examples with `vmap(func)`. `func` however\nis subject to many restrictions:\n\n- it must be functional (one cannot mutate a Python data structure\n  inside of it), with the exception of in-place PyTorch operations.\n- batches of examples must be provided as Tensors. This means that\n  vmap doesn't handle variable-length sequences out of the box.\n\nOne example of using `vmap` is to compute batched dot products. PyTorch\ndoesn't provide a batched `torch.dot` API; instead of unsuccessfully\nrummaging through docs, use `vmap` to construct a new function:\n\n"

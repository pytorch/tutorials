        "\n# Reinforcement Learning (DQN) Tutorial\n**Author**: [Adam Paszke](https://github.com/apaszke)\n            [Mark Towers](https://github.com/pseudo-rnd-thoughts)\n\n\nThis tutorial shows how to use PyTorch to train a Deep Q Learning (DQN) agent\non the CartPole-v1 task from [Gymnasium](https://www.gymnasium.farama.org)_.\n\n**Task**\n\nThe agent has to decide between two actions - moving the cart left or\nright - so that the pole attached to it stays upright. You can find more\ninformation about the environment and other more challenging environments at\n[Gymnasium's website](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/)_.\n\n.. figure:: /_static/img/cartpole.gif\n   :alt: cartpole\n\n   cartpole\n\nAs the agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses\nan action, the environment *transitions* to a new state, and also\nreturns a reward that indicates the consequences of the action. In this\ntask, rewards are +1 for every incremental timestep and the environment\nterminates if the pole falls over too far or the cart moves more than 2.4\nunits away from center. This means better performing scenarios will run\nfor longer duration, accumulating larger return.\n\nThe CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real\nvalues representing the environment state (position, velocity, etc.).\nWe take these 4 inputs without any scaling and pass them through a \nsmall fully-connected network with 2 outputs, one for each action. \nThe network is trained to predict the expected value for each action, \ngiven the input state. The action with the highest expected value is \nthen chosen.\n\n\n**Packages**\n\n\nFirst, let's import needed packages. Firstly, we need\n[gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)_ for the environment,\ninstalled by using `pip`. This is a fork of the original OpenAI\nGym project and maintained by the same team since Gym v0.19.\nIf you are running this in Google colab, run:\n"

        "Now, let's define our model. But first, let's quickly recap what a DQN is.\n\n## DQN algorithm\n\nOur environment is deterministic, so all equations presented here are\nalso formulated deterministically for the sake of simplicity. In the\nreinforcement learning literature, they would also contain expectations\nover stochastic transitions in the environment.\n\nOur aim will be to train a policy that tries to maximize the discounted,\ncumulative reward\n$R_{t_0} = \\sum_{t=t_0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^{t - t_0} r_t$, where\n$R_{t_0}$ is also known as the *return*. The discount,\n$\\gamma$, should be a constant between $0$ and $1$\nthat ensures the sum converges. A lower $\\gamma$ makes \nrewards from the uncertain far future less important for our agent \nthan the ones in the near future that it can be fairly confident \nabout. It also encourages agents to collect reward closer in time \nthan equivalent rewards that are temporally far away in the future.\n\nThe main idea behind Q-learning is that if we had a function\n$Q^*: State \\times Action \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, that could tell\nus what our return would be, if we were to take an action in a given\nstate, then we could easily construct a policy that maximizes our\nrewards:\n\n\\begin{align}\\pi^*(s) = \\arg\\!\\max_a \\ Q^*(s, a)\\end{align}\n\nHowever, we don't know everything about the world, so we don't have\naccess to $Q^*$. But, since neural networks are universal function\napproximators, we can simply create one and train it to resemble\n$Q^*$.\n\nFor our training update rule, we'll use a fact that every $Q$\nfunction for some policy obeys the Bellman equation:\n\n\\begin{align}Q^{\\pi}(s, a) = r + \\gamma Q^{\\pi}(s', \\pi(s'))\\end{align}\n\nThe difference between the two sides of the equality is known as the\ntemporal difference error, $\\delta$:\n\n\\begin{align}\\delta = Q(s, a) - (r + \\gamma \\max_a' Q(s', a))\\end{align}\n\nTo minimise this error, we will use the [Huber\nloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss)_. The Huber loss acts\nlike the mean squared error when the error is small, but like the mean\nabsolute error when the error is large - this makes it more robust to\noutliers when the estimates of $Q$ are very noisy. We calculate\nthis over a batch of transitions, $B$, sampled from the replay\nmemory:\n\n\\begin{align}\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{|B|}\\sum_{(s, a, s', r) \\ \\in \\ B} \\mathcal{L}(\\delta)\\end{align}\n\n\\begin{align}\\text{where} \\quad \\mathcal{L}(\\delta) = \\begin{cases}\n     \\frac{1}{2}{\\delta^2}  & \\text{for } |\\delta| \\le 1, \\\\\n     |\\delta| - \\frac{1}{2} & \\text{otherwise.}\n   \\end{cases}\\end{align}\n\n### Q-network\n\nOur model will be a convolutional neural network that takes in the\ndifference between the current and previous screen patches. It has two\noutputs, representing $Q(s, \\mathrm{left})$ and\n$Q(s, \\mathrm{right})$ (where $s$ is the input to the\nnetwork). In effect, the network is trying to predict the *expected return* of\ntaking each action given the current input.\n\n\n"

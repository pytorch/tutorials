    "constant between $0$ and $1$ that ensures the sum converges. A lower\n",
    "$\\gamma$ makes rewards from the uncertain far future less important for\n",
    "our agent than the ones in the near future that it can be fairly\n",
    "confident about. It also encourages agents to collect reward closer in\n",
    "time than equivalent rewards that are temporally far away in the future.\n",
    "\n",

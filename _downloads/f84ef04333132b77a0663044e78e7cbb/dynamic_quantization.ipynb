        "\n# Dynamic Quantization\n\nIn this recipe you will see how to take advantage of Dynamic\nQuantization to accelerate inference on an LSTM-style recurrent neural\nnetwork. This reduces the size of the model weights and speeds up model\nexecution.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThere are a number of trade-offs that can be made when designing neural\nnetworks. During model development and training you can alter the\nnumber of layers and number of parameters in a recurrent neural network\nand trade-off accuracy against model size and/or model latency or\nthroughput. Such changes can take lot of time and compute resources\nbecause you are iterating over the model training. Quantization gives\nyou a way to make a similar trade off between performance and model\naccuracy with a known model after training is completed.\n\nYou can give it a try in a single session and you will certainly reduce\nyour model size significantly and may get a significant latency\nreduction without losing a lot of accuracy.\n\n## What is dynamic quantization?\n\nQuantizing a network means converting it to use a reduced precision\ninteger representation for the weights and/or activations. This saves on\nmodel size and allows the use of higher throughput math operations on\nyour CPU or GPU.\n\nWhen converting from floating point to integer values you are\nessentially multiplying the floating point value by some scale factor\nand rounding the result to a whole number. The various quantization\napproaches differ in the way they approach determining that scale\nfactor.\n\nThe key idea with dynamic quantization as described here is that we are\ngoing to determine the scale factor for activations dynamically based on\nthe data range observed at runtime. This ensures that the scale factor\nis \"tuned\" so that as much signal as possible about each observed\ndataset is preserved.\n\nThe model parameters on the other hand are known during model conversion\nand they are converted ahead of time and stored in INT8 form.\n\nArithmetic in the quantized model is done using vectorized INT8\ninstructions. Accumulation is typically done with INT16 or INT32 to\navoid overflow. This higher precision value is scaled back to INT8 if\nthe next layer is quantized or converted to FP32 for output.\n\nDynamic quantization is relatively free of tuning parameters which makes\nit well suited to be added into production pipelines as a standard part\nof converting LSTM models to deployment.\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Limitations on the approach taken here\n\n\n   This recipe provides a quick introduction to the dynamic quantization\n   features in PyTorch and the workflow for using it. Our focus is on\n   explaining the specific functions used to convert the model. We will\n   make a number of significant simplifications in the interest of brevity\n   and clarity</p></div>\n\n\n1. You will start with a minimal LSTM network\n2. You are simply going to initialize the network with a random hidden\n   state\n3. You are going to test the network with random inputs\n4. You are not going to train the network in this tutorial\n5. You will see that the quantized form of this network is smaller and\n   runs faster than the floating point network we started with\n6. You will see that the output values are generally in the same\n   ballpark as the output of the FP32 network, but we are not\n   demonstrating here the expected accuracy loss on a real trained\n   network\n\nYou will see how dynamic quantization is done and be able to see\nsuggestive reductions in memory use and latency times. Providing a\ndemonstration that the technique can preserve high levels of model\naccuracy on a trained LSTM is left to a more advanced tutorial. If you\nwant to move right away to that more rigorous treatment please proceed\nto the [advanced dynamic quantization\ntutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/dynamic_quantization_tutorial.html)_.\n\n## Steps\n\nThis recipe has 5 steps.\n\n1. Set Up - Here you define a very simple LSTM, import modules, and establish\n   some random input tensors.\n\n2. Do the Quantization - Here you instantiate a floating point model and then create quantized\n   version of it.\n\n3. Look at Model Size - Here you show that the model size gets smaller.\n\n4. Look at Latency - Here you run the two models and compare model runtime (latency).\n\n5. Look at Accuracy - Here you run the two models and compare outputs.\n\n\n### 1: Set Up\nThis is a straightforward bit of code to set up for the rest of the\nrecipe.\n\nThe unique module we are importing here is torch.quantization which\nincludes PyTorch's quantized operators and conversion functions. We also\ndefine a very simple LSTM model and set up some inputs.\n"

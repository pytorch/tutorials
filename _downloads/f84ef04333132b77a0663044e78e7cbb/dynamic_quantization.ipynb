    "Dynamic Quantization\n",
    "====================\n",
    "\n",
    "In this recipe you will see how to take advantage of Dynamic\n",
    "Quantization to accelerate inference on an LSTM-style recurrent neural\n",
    "network. This reduces the size of the model weights and speeds up model\n",
    "execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of trade-offs that can be made when designing neural\n",
    "networks. During model development and training you can alter the number\n",
    "of layers and number of parameters in a recurrent neural network and\n",
    "trade-off accuracy against model size and/or model latency or\n",
    "throughput. Such changes can take lot of time and compute resources\n",
    "because you are iterating over the model training. Quantization gives\n",
    "you a way to make a similar trade off between performance and model\n",
    "accuracy with a known model after training is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can give it a try in a single session and you will certainly reduce\n",
    "your model size significantly and may get a significant latency\n",
    "reduction without losing a lot of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is dynamic quantization?\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantizing a network means converting it to use a reduced precision\n",
    "integer representation for the weights and/or activations. This saves on\n",
    "model size and allows the use of higher throughput math operations on\n",
    "your CPU or GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "When converting from floating point to integer values you are\n",
    "essentially multiplying the floating point value by some scale factor\n",
    "and rounding the result to a whole number. The various quantization\n",
    "approaches differ in the way they approach determining that scale\n",
    "factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea with dynamic quantization as described here is that we are\n",
    "going to determine the scale factor for activations dynamically based on\n",
    "the data range observed at runtime. This ensures that the scale factor\n",
    "is \\\"tuned\\\" so that as much signal as possible about each observed\n",
    "dataset is preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model parameters on the other hand are known during model conversion\n",
    "and they are converted ahead of time and stored in INT8 form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic in the quantized model is done using vectorized INT8\n",
    "instructions. Accumulation is typically done with INT16 or INT32 to\n",
    "avoid overflow. This higher precision value is scaled back to INT8 if\n",
    "the next layer is quantized or converted to FP32 for output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic quantization is relatively free of tuning parameters which makes\n",
    "it well suited to be added into production pipelines as a standard part\n",
    "of converting LSTM models to deployment.\n",
    "\n",

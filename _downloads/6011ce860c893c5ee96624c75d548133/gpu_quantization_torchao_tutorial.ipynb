These\nsteps will mimic some of those taken to develop the\n[segment-anything-fast](https://github.com/pytorch-labs/segment-anything-fast/blob/main/segment_anything_fast/modeling/image_encoder.py#L15)\nrepo. This step-by-step guide demonstrates how you can\napply these techniques to speed up your own models, especially those\nthat use transformers. To that end, we will focus on widely applicable\ntechniques, such as optimizing performance with ``torch.compile`` and\nquantization and measure their impact.\n"

If you\nare using a different hardware, you might see different performance numbers.\n\n\n```bash\n> conda create -n myenv python=3.10\n> pip3 install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu121\n> pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git\n> pip install git+https://github.com/pytorch-labs/ao.git\n```\nSegment Anything Model checkpoint setup:\n\n1. Go to the [segment-anything repo](checkpoint https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/tree/main#model-checkpoints) and download the ``vit_h`` checkpoint. Alternatively, you can just use ``wget``: `wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth --directory-prefix=<path>\n2. Pass in that directory by editing the code below to say:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n{sam_checkpoint_base_path}=<path>\n\nThis was run on an A100-PG509-200 power limited to 330.00 W\n\n\n"

        "The first time this is run, you should see a sequence of ``AUTOTUNE``\noutputs which occurs when inductor compares the performance between\nvarious kernel parameters for a kernel. This only happens once (unless\nyou delete your cache) so if you run the cell again you should just get\nthe benchmark output.\n\n``torch.compile`` yields about another 27% improvement. This brings the\nmodel to a reasonable baseline where we now have to work a bit harder\nfor improvements.\n\nNext, let's apply quantization. Quantization for GPUs comes in three main forms\nin [torchao](https://github.com/pytorch-labs/ao) which is just native\npytorch+python code. This includes:\n\n* int8 dynamic quantization\n* int8 weight-only quantization\n* int4 weight-only quantization\n\nDifferent models, or sometimes different layers in a model can require different techniques.\nFor models which are heavily compute bound, dynamic quantization tends\nto work the best since it swaps the normal expensive floating point\nmatmul ops with integer versions. Weight-only quantization works better\nin memory bound situations where the benefit comes from loading less\nweight data, rather than doing less computation. The torchao APIs:\n\n``change_linear_weights_to_int8_dqtensors``,\n``change_linear_weights_to_int8_woqtensors`` or\n``change_linear_weights_to_int4_woqtensors``\n\ncan be used to easily apply the desired quantization technique and then\nonce the model is compiled with ``torch.compile`` with ``max-autotune``, quantization is\ncomplete and we can see our speedup.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>You might experience issues with these on older versions of PyTorch. If you run\n   into an issue, you can use ``apply_dynamic_quant`` and\n   ``apply_weight_only_int8_quant`` instead as drop in replacement for the two\n   above (no replacement for int4).</p></div>\n\n The difference between the two APIs is that ``change_linear_weights`` API\nalters the weight tensor of the linear module so instead of doing a\nnormal linear, it does a quantized operation. This is helpful when you\nhave non-standard linear ops that do more than one thing. The ``apply``\nAPIs directly swap the linear modules for a quantized module which\nworks on older versions but doesn\u2019t work with non-standard linear\nmodules.\n\nIn this case Segment Anything is compute-bound so we\u2019ll use dynamic quantization:\n\n\n"

For small\n   batch sizes this overhead can actually make the model go slower.\n2) Even though we are doing a quantized matmul, such as\u00a0``int8 x int8``,\n   the result of the multiplication gets stored in an int32 tensor\n   which is twice the size of the result from the non-quantized model.\n   If we can avoid creating this int32 tensor, our memory usage will improve a lot.\n\nWe can fix #2 by fusing the integer matmul with the subsequent rescale\noperation since the final output will be bf16, if we immediately convert\nthe int32 tensor to bf16 and instead store that we\u2019ll get better\nperformance in terms of both runtime and memory.\n\nThe way to do this, is to enable the option\n``force_fuse_int_mm_with_mul`` in the inductor config.\n\n\n"

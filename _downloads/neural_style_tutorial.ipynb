        "\nNeural Transfer with PyTorch\n============================\n**Author**: `Alexis Jacq <https://alexis-jacq.github.io>`_\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nWelcome! This tutorial explains how to impletment the\n`Neural-Style <https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576>`__ algorithm developed\nby Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge.\n\nNeural what?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Neural-Style, or Neural-Transfer, is an algorithm that takes as\ninput a content-image (e.g. a tortle), a style-image (e.g. artistic\nwaves) and return the content of the content-image as if it was\n'painted' using the artistic style of the style-image:\n\n.. figure:: /_static/img/neural-style/neuralstyle.png\n   :alt: content1\n\nHow does it work?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe principle is simple: we define two distances, one for the content\n($D_C$) and one for the style ($D_S$). $D_C$ measures\nhow different the content is between two images, while $D_S$\nmeasures how different the style is between two images. Then, we take a\nthird image, the input, (e.g. a with noise), and we transform it in\norder to both minimize its content-distance with the content-image and\nits style-distance with the style-image.\n\nOK. How does it work?\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWell, going further requires some mathematics. Let $C_{nn}$ be a\npre-trained deep convolutional neural network and $X$ be any\nimage. $C_{nn}(X)$ is the network fed by $X$ (containing\nfeature maps at all layers). Let $F_{XL} \\in C_{nn}(X)$ be the\nfeature maps at depth layer $L$, all vectorized and concatenated\nin one single vector. We simply define the content of $X$ at layer\n$L$ by $F_{XL}$. Then, if $Y$ is another image of same\nthe size than $X$, we define the distance of content at layer\n$L$ as follow:\n\n\\begin{align}D_C^L(X,Y) = \\|F_{XL} - F_{YL}\\|^2 = \\sum_i (F_{XL}(i) - F_{YL}(i))^2\\end{align}\n\nWhere $F_{XL}(i)$ is the $i^{th}$ element of $F_{XL}$.\nThe style is a bit less trivial to define. Let $F_{XL}^k$ with\n$k \\leq K$ be the vectorized $k^{th}$ of the $K$\nfeature maps at layer $L$. The style $G_{XL}$ of $X$\nat layer $L$ is defined by the Gram produce of all vectorized\nfeature maps $F_{XL}^k$ with $k \\leq K$. In other words,\n$G_{XL}$ is a $K$\\ x\\ $K$ matrix and the element\n$G_{XL}(k,l)$ at the $k^{th}$ line and $l^{th}$ column\nof $G_{XL}$ is the vectorial produce between $F_{XL}^k$ and\n$F_{XL}^l$ :\n\n\\begin{align}G_{XL}(k,l) = \\langle F_{XL}^k, F_{XL}^l\\rangle = \\sum_i F_{XL}^k(i) . F_{XL}^l(i)\\end{align}\n\nWhere $F_{XL}^k(i)$ is the $i^{th}$ element of\n$F_{XL}^k$. We can see $G_{XL}(k,l)$ as a measure of the\ncorrelation between feature maps $k$ and $l$. In that way,\n$G_{XL}$ represents the correlation matrix of feature maps of\n$X$ at layer $L$. Note that the size of $G_{XL}$ only\ndepends on the number of feature maps, not on the size of $X$.\nThen, if $Y$ is another image *of any size*, we define the\ndistance of style at layer $L$ as follow:\n\n\\begin{align}D_S^L(X,Y) = \\|G_{XL} - G_{YL}\\|^2 = \\sum_{k,l} (G_{XL}(k,l) - G_{YL}(k,l))^2\\end{align}\n\nIn order to minimize in one shot $D_C(X,C)$ between a variable\nimage $X$ and target content-image $C$ and $D_S(X,S)$\nbetween $X$ and target style-image $S$, both computed at\nseveral layers , we compute and sum the gradients (derivative with\nrespect to $X$) of each distance at each wanted layer:\n\n\\begin{align}\\nabla_{\textit{total}}(X,S,C) = \\sum_{L_C} w_{CL_C}.\\nabla_{\textit{content}}^{L_C}(X,C) + \\sum_{L_S} w_{SL_S}.\\nabla_{\textit{style}}^{L_S}(X,S)\\end{align}\n\nWhere $L_C$ and $L_S$ are respectivement the wanted layers\n(arbitrary stated) of content and style and $w_{CL_C}$ and\n$w_{SL_S}$ the weights (arbitrary stated) associated with the\nstyle or the content at each wanted layer. Then, we run a gradient\ndescent over $X$:\n\n\\begin{align}X \\leftarrow X - \\alpha \\nabla_{\textit{total}}(X,S,C)\\end{align}\n\nOk. That's enough with maths. If you want to go deeper (how to compute\nthe gradients) **we encourage you to read the original paper** by Leon\nA. Gatys and AL, where everything is much better and much clearer\nexplained. \n\nFor our implementation in PyTorch, we already have everything\nwe need: indeed, with PyTorch, all the gradients are automatically and\ndynamically computed for you (while you use functions from the library).\nThis is why the implementation of this algorithm becomes very\nconfortable with PyTorch.\n\nPyTorch implementation\n----------------------\n\nIf you are not sure to understand all the mathematics above, you will\nprobably get it by implementing it. If you are discovering PyTorch, we\nrecommend you to first read this :doc:`Introduction to\nPyTorch </beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz>`.\n\nPackages\n~~~~~~~~\n\nWe will have recourse to the following packages:\n\n-  ``torch``, ``torch.nn``, ``numpy`` (indispensables packages for\n   neural networks with PyTorch)\n-  ``torch.autograd.Variable`` (dynamic computation of the gradient wrt\n   a variable)\n-  ``torch.optim`` (efficient gradient descents)\n-  ``PIL``, ``PIL.Image``, ``matplotlib.pyplot`` (load and display\n   images)\n-  ``torchvision.transforms`` (treat PIL images and transform into torch\n   tensors)\n-  ``torchvision.models`` (train or load pre-trained models)\n-  ``copy`` (to deep copy the models; system package)\n\n"

Hence, the weight $w_{CL}$ and\nthe target content $F_{CL}$ are parameters of the function. We\nimplement this function as a torch module with a constructor that takes\nthese parameters as input. The distance $\\|F_{XL} - F_{YL}\\|^2$ is\nthe Mean Square Error between the two sets of feature maps, that can be\ncomputed using a criterion ``nn.MSELoss`` stated as a third parameter.\n\nWe will add our content losses at each desired layer as additive modules\nof the neural network. That way, each time we will feed the network with\nan input image $X$, all the content losses will be computed at the\ndesired layers and, thanks to autograd, all the gradients will be\ncomputed. For that, we just need to make the ``forward`` method of our\nmodule returning the input: the module becomes a ''transparent layer''\nof the neural network. The computed loss is saved as a parameter of the\nmodule.\n\nFinally, we define a fake ``backward`` method, that just call the\nbackward method of ``nn.MSELoss`` in order to reconstruct the gradient.\nThis method returns the computed loss: this will be useful when running\nthe gradient descent in order to display the evolution of style and\ncontent losses.\n\n\n"

Unlike\ntraining a network, we want to train the input image in order to\nminimise the content/style losses. We would like to simply create a\nPyTorch  L-BFGS optimizer, passing our image as the variable to optimize.\nBut ``optim.LBFGS`` takes as first argument a list of PyTorch\n``Variable`` that require gradient. Our input image is a ``Variable``\nbut is not a leaf of the tree that requires computation of gradients. In\norder to show that this variable requires a gradient, a possibility is\nto construct a ``Parameter`` object from the input image. Then, we just\ngive a list containing this ``Parameter`` to the optimizer's\nconstructor:\n\n\n"

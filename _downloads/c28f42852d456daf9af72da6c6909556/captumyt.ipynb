    "Introduction\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Captum's approach to model interpretability is in terms of\n",
    "*attributions.* There are three kinds of attributions available in\n",
    "Captum:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Feature Attribution** seeks to explain a particular output in\n",
    "    terms of features of the input that generated it. Explaining whether\n",
    "    a movie review was positive or negative in terms of certain words in\n",
    "    the review is an example of feature attribution.\n",
    "-   **Layer Attribution** examines the activity of a model's hidden\n",
    "    layer subsequent to a particular input. Examining the\n",
    "    spatially-mapped output of a convolutional layer in response to an\n",
    "    input image in an example of layer attribution.\n",
    "-   **Neuron Attribution** is analagous to layer attribution, but\n",
    "    focuses on the activity of a single neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this interactive notebook, we'll look at Feature Attribution and\n",
    "Layer Attribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the three attribution types has multiple **attribution\n",
    "algorithms** associated with it. Many attribution algorithms fall into\n",
    "two broad categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Gradient-based algorithms** calculate the backward gradients of a\n",
    "    model output, layer output, or neuron activation with respect to the\n",
    "    input. **Integrated Gradients** (for features), **Layer Gradient \\*\n",
    "    Activation**, and **Neuron Conductance** are all gradient-based\n",
    "    algorithms.\n",
    "-   **Perturbation-based algorithms** examine the changes in the output\n",
    "    of a model, layer, or neuron in response to changes in the input.\n",
    "    The input perturbations may be directed or random. **Occlusion,**\n",
    "    **Feature Ablation,** and **Feature Permutation** are all\n",
    "    perturbation-based algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be examining algorithms of both types below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially where large models are involved, it can be valuable to\n",
    "visualize attribution data in ways that relate it easily to the input\n",
    "features being examined. While it is certainly possible to create your\n",
    "own visualizations with Matplotlib, Plotly, or similar tools, Captum\n",
    "offers enhanced tools specific to its attributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The `captum.attr.visualization` module (imported below as `viz`)\n",
    "    provides helpful functions for visualizing attributions related to\n",
    "    images.\n",
    "-   **Captum Insights** is an easy-to-use API on top of Captum that\n",
    "    provides a visualization widget with ready-made visualizations for\n",
    "    image, text, and arbitrary model types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these visualization toolsets will be demonstrated in this\n",
    "notebook. The first few examples will focus on computer vision use\n",
    "cases, but the Captum Insights section at the end will demonstrate\n",
    "visualization of attributions in a multi-model, visual\n",
    "question-and-answer model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",

        "\n(experimental) Introduction to Named Tensors in PyTorch\n*******************************************************\n**Author**: `Richard Zou <https://github.com/zou3519>`_\n\nNamed Tensors aim to make tensors easier to use by allowing users to associate\nexplicit names with tensor dimensions. In most cases, operations that take\ndimension parameters will accept dimension names, avoiding the need to track\ndimensions by position. In addition, named tensors use names to automatically\ncheck that APIs are being used correctly at runtime, providing extra safety.\nNames can also be used to rearrange dimensions, for example, to support\n\"broadcasting by name\" rather than \"broadcasting by position\".\n\nThis tutorial is intended as a guide to the functionality that will\nbe included with the 1.3 launch. By the end of it, you will be able to:\n\n- Create Tensors with named dimensions, as well as remove or rename those\n  dimensions\n- Understand the basics of how operations propagate dimension names\n- See how naming dimensions enables clearer code in two key areas:\n    - Broadcasting operations\n    - Flattening and unflattening dimensions\n\nFinally, we'll put this into practice by writing a multi-head attention module\nusing named tensors.\n\nNamed tensors in PyTorch are inspired by and done in collaboration with\n`Sasha Rush <https://tech.cornell.edu/people/alexander-rush/>`_.\nSasha proposed the original idea and proof of concept in his\n`January 2019 blog post <http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/NamedTensor>`_.\n\nBasics: named dimensions\n========================\n\nPyTorch now allows Tensors to have named dimensions; factory functions\ntake a new `names` argument that associates a name with each dimension.\nThis works with most factory functions, such as\n\n- `tensor`\n- `empty`\n- `ones`\n- `zeros`\n- `randn`\n- `rand`\n\nHere we construct a tensor with names:\n\n"

        "\n# Forward-mode Automatic Differentiation (Beta)\n\nThis tutorial demonstrates how to use forward-mode AD to compute\ndirectional derivatives (or equivalently, Jacobian-vector products).\n\nThe tutorial below uses some APIs only available in versions >= 1.11\n(or nightly builds).\n\nAlso note that forward-mode AD is currently in beta. The API is\nsubject to change and operator coverage is still incomplete.\n\n## Basic Usage\nUnlike reverse-mode AD, forward-mode AD computes gradients eagerly\nalongside the forward pass. We can use forward-mode AD to compute a\ndirectional derivative by performing the forward pass as before,\nexcept we first associate our input with another tensor representing\nthe direction of the directional derivative (or equivalently, the ``v``\nin a Jacobian-vector product). When an input, which we call \"primal\", is\nassociated with a \"direction\" tensor, which we call \"tangent\", the\nresultant new tensor object is called a \"dual tensor\" for its connection\nto dual numbers[0].\n\nAs the forward pass is performed, if any input tensors are dual tensors,\nextra computation is performed to propagate this \"sensitivity\" of the\nfunction.\n"

    "knowledge of GANs is required, but it may require a first-timer to spend\n",
    "some time reasoning about what is actually happening under the hood.\n",

    "Generative Adversarial Networks\n",
    "===============================\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a GAN?\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs are a framework for teaching a deep learning model to capture the\n",
    "training data distribution so we can generate new data from that same\n",
    "distribution. GANs were invented by Ian Goodfellow in 2014 and first\n",
    "described in the paper [Generative Adversarial\n",
    "Nets](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf).\n",
    "They are made of two distinct models, a *generator* and a\n",
    "*discriminator*. The job of the generator is to spawn 'fake' images that\n",
    "look like the training images. The job of the discriminator is to look\n",
    "at an image and output whether or not it is a real training image or a\n",
    "fake image from the generator. During training, the generator is\n",
    "constantly trying to outsmart the discriminator by generating better and\n",
    "better fakes, while the discriminator is working to become a better\n",
    "detective and correctly classify the real and fake images. The\n",
    "equilibrium of this game is when the generator is generating perfect\n",
    "fakes that look as if they came directly from the training data, and the\n",
    "discriminator is left to always guess at 50% confidence that the\n",
    "generator output is real or fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, lets define some notation to be used throughout tutorial starting\n",
    "with the discriminator. Let $x$ be data representing an image. $D(x)$ is\n",
    "the discriminator network which outputs the (scalar) probability that\n",
    "$x$ came from training data rather than the generator. Here, since we\n",
    "are dealing with images, the input to $D(x)$ is an image of CHW size\n",
    "3x64x64. Intuitively, $D(x)$ should be HIGH when $x$ comes from training\n",
    "data and LOW when $x$ comes from the generator. $D(x)$ can also be\n",
    "thought of as a traditional binary classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the generator's notation, let $z$ be a latent space vector sampled\n",
    "from a standard normal distribution. $G(z)$ represents the generator\n",
    "function which maps the latent vector $z$ to data-space. The goal of $G$\n",
    "is to estimate the distribution that the training data comes from\n",
    "($p_{data}$) so it can generate fake samples from that estimated\n",
    "distribution ($p_g$).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, $D(G(z))$ is the probability (scalar) that the output of the\n",
    "generator $G$ is a real image. As described in [Goodfellow's\n",
    "paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf),\n",
    "$D$ and $G$ play a minimax game in which $D$ tries to maximize the\n",
    "probability it correctly classifies reals and fakes ($logD(x)$), and $G$\n",
    "tries to minimize the probability that $D$ will predict its outputs are\n",
    "fake ($log(1-D(G(z)))$). From the paper, the GAN loss function is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\underset{G}{\\text{min}} \\underset{D}{\\text{max}}V(D,G) = \\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim p_{data}(x)}\\big[logD(x)\\big] + \\mathbb{E}_{z\\sim p_{z}(z)}\\big[log(1-D(G(z)))\\big]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, the solution to this minimax game is where $p_g = p_{data}$,\n",
    "and the discriminator guesses randomly if the inputs are real or fake.\n",
    "However, the convergence theory of GANs is still being actively\n",
    "researched and in reality models do not always train to this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a DCGAN?\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "A DCGAN is a direct extension of the GAN described above, except that it\n",
    "explicitly uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers in the\n",
    "discriminator and generator, respectively. It was first described by\n",
    "Radford et. al. in the paper [Unsupervised Representation Learning With\n",
    "Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial\n",
    "Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf). The discriminator is\n",

    "activations. The input is a 3x64x64 input image and the output is a\n",
    "scalar probability that the input is from the real data distribution.\n",
    "The generator is comprised of\n",
    "[convolutional-transpose](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d)\n",
    "layers, batch norm layers, and\n",

    "input is a latent vector, $z$, that is drawn from a standard normal\n",
    "distribution and the output is a 3x64x64 RGB image. The strided\n",
    "conv-transpose layers allow the latent vector to be transformed into a\n",
    "volume with the same shape as an image. In the paper, the authors also\n",
    "give some tips about how to setup the optimizers, how to calculate the\n",
    "loss functions, and how to initialize the model weights, all of which\n",

    "Algorithm 1 from the [Goodfellow's\n",
    "paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf),\n",
    "while abiding by some of the best practices shown in\n",
    "[ganhacks](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks). Namely, we will\n",
    "\"construct different mini-batches for real and fake\" images, and also\n",
    "adjust G's objective function to maximize $log(D(G(z)))$. Training is\n",
    "split up into two main parts. Part 1 updates the Discriminator and Part\n",
    "2 updates the Generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1 - Train the Discriminator**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, the goal of training the discriminator is to maximize the\n",
    "probability of correctly classifying a given input as real or fake. In\n",
    "terms of Goodfellow, we wish to \"update the discriminator by ascending\n",
    "its stochastic gradient\". Practically, we want to maximize\n",
    "$log(D(x)) + log(1-D(G(z)))$. Due to the separate mini-batch suggestion\n",
    "from [ganhacks](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks), we will calculate\n",
    "this in two steps. First, we will construct a batch of real samples from\n",
    "the training set, forward pass through $D$, calculate the loss\n",
    "($log(D(x))$), then calculate the gradients in a backward pass.\n",
    "Secondly, we will construct a batch of fake samples with the current\n",
    "generator, forward pass this batch through $D$, calculate the loss\n",
    "($log(1-D(G(z)))$), and *accumulate* the gradients with a backward pass.\n",
    "Now, with the gradients accumulated from both the all-real and all-fake\n",
    "batches, we call a step of the Discriminator's optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2 - Train the Generator**\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in the original paper, we want to train the Generator by\n",
    "minimizing $log(1-D(G(z)))$ in an effort to generate better fakes. As\n",
    "mentioned, this was shown by Goodfellow to not provide sufficient\n",
    "gradients, especially early in the learning process. As a fix, we\n",
    "instead wish to maximize $log(D(G(z)))$. In the code we accomplish this\n",
    "by: classifying the Generator output from Part 1 with the Discriminator,\n",
    "computing G's loss *using real labels as GT*, computing G's gradients in\n",
    "a backward pass, and finally updating G's parameters with an optimizer\n",
    "step. It may seem counter-intuitive to use the real labels as GT labels\n",
    "for the loss function, but this allows us to use the $log(x)$ part of\n",
    "the `BCELoss` (rather than the $log(1-x)$ part) which is exactly what we\n",
    "want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will do some statistic reporting and at the end of each\n",

    "-   **Loss\\_G** - generator loss calculated as $log(D(G(z)))$\n",
    "-   **D(x)** - the average output (across the batch) of the\n",
    "    discriminator for the all real batch. This should start close to 1\n",
    "    then theoretically converge to 0.5 when G gets better. Think about\n",
    "    why this is.\n",
    "-   **D(G(z))** - average discriminator outputs for the all fake batch.\n",
    "    The first number is before D is updated and the second number is\n",

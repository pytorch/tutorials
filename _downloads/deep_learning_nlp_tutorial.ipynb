        "\nDeep Learning for Natural Language Processing with Pytorch\n**********************************************************\n**Author**: `Robert Guthrie <https://github.com/rguthrie3/DeepLearningForNLPInPytorch>`_\n\nThis tutorial will walk you through the key ideas of deep learning\nprogramming using Pytorch. Many of the concepts (such as the computation\ngraph abstraction and autograd) are not unique to Pytorch and are\nrelevant to any deep learning tool kit out there.\n\nI am writing this tutorial to focus specifically on NLP for people who\nhave never written code in any deep learning framework (e.g, TensorFlow,\nTheano, Keras, Dynet). It assumes working knowledge of core NLP\nproblems: part-of-speech tagging, language modeling, etc. It also\nassumes familiarity with neural networks at the level of an intro AI\nclass (such as one from the Russel and Norvig book). Usually, these\ncourses cover the basic backpropagation algorithm on feed-forward neural\nnetworks, and make the point that they are chains of compositions of\nlinearities and non-linearities. This tutorial aims to get you started\nwriting deep learning code, given you have this prerequisite knowledge.\n\nNote this is about *models*, not data. For all of the models, I just\ncreate a few test examples with small dimensionality so you can see how\nthe weights change as it trains. If you have some real data you want to\ntry, you should be able to rip out any of the models from this notebook\nand use them on it.\n\n\n"

Trying different update algorithms and different\nparameters for the update algorithms (like different initial learning\nrates) is important in optimizing your network's performance. Often,\njust replacing vanilla SGD with an optimizer like Adam or RMSProp will\nboost performance noticably.\n\n\n"

Creating Network Components in Pytorch\n=========================================\n\nBefore we move on to our focus on NLP, lets do an annotated example of\nbuilding a network in Pytorch using only affine maps and\nnon-linearities. We will also see how to compute a loss function, using\nPytorch's built in negative log likelihood, and update parameters by\nbackpropagation.\n\nAll network components should inherit from nn.Module and override the\nforward() method. That is about it, as far as the boilerplate is\nconcerned. Inheriting from nn.Module provides functionality to your\ncomponent. For example, it makes it keep track of its trainable\nparameters, you can swap it between CPU and GPU with the .cuda() or\n.cpu() functions, etc.\n\nLet's write an annotated example of a network that takes in a sparse\nbag-of-words representation and outputs a probability distribution over\ntwo labels: \"English\" and \"Spanish\".

Even more, in what sense could you\ncombine these representations? We often want dense outputs from our\nneural networks, where the inputs are $|V|$ dimensional, where\n$V$ is our vocabulary, but often the outputs are only a few\ndimensional (if we are only predicting a handful of labels, for\ninstance). How do we get from a massive dimensional space to a smaller\ndimensional space?\n\nHow about instead of ascii representations, we use a one-hot encoding?\nThat is, we represent the word $w$ by\n\n\\begin{align}\\overbrace{\\left[ 0, 0, \\dots, 1, \\dots, 0, 0 \\right]}^\\text{|V| elements}\\end{align}\n\nwhere the 1 is in a location unique to $w$.

Sequence models are central to NLP: they are\nmodels where there is some sort of dependence through time between your\ninputs. The classical example of a sequence model is the Hidden Markov\nModel for part-of-speech tagging. Another example is the conditional\nrandom field.\n\nA recurrent neural network is a network that maintains some kind of\nstate. For example, its output could be used as part of the next input,\nso that information can propogate along as the network passes over the\nsequence. In the case of an LSTM, for each element in the sequence,\nthere is a corresponding *hidden state* $h_t$, which in principle\ncan contain information from arbitrary points earlier in the sequence.\nWe can use the hidden state to predict words in a language model,\npart-of-speech tags, and a myriad of other things.\n\n\n"

        "Exercise: Augmenting the LSTM part-of-speech tagger with character-level features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn the example above, each word had an embedding, which served as the\ninputs to our sequence model. Let's augment the word embeddings with a\nrepresentation derived from the characters of the word. We expect that\nthis should help significantly, since character-level information like\naffixes have a large bearing on part-of-speech. For example, words with\nthe affix *-ly* are almost always tagged as adverbs in English.\n\nDo do this, let $c_w$ be the character-level representation of\nword $w$.

So if $x_w$ has dimension 5, and $c_w$\ndimension 3, then our LSTM should accept an input of dimension 8.\n\nTo get the character level representation, do an LSTM over the\ncharacters of a word, and let $c_w$ be the final hidden state of\nthis LSTM. Hints: \n* There are going to be two LSTM's in your new model.\n  The original one that outputs POS tag scores, and the new one that\n  outputs a character-level representation of each word.\n* To do a sequence model over characters, you will have to embed characters.\n  The character embeddings will be the input to the character LSTM.\n\n\n"

        "Dyanmic versus Static Deep Learning Toolkits\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPytorch is a *dynamic* neural network kit. Another example of a dynamic\nkit is `Dynet <https://github.com/clab/dynet>`__ (I mention this because\nworking with Pytorch and Dynet is similar. If you see an example in\nDynet, it will probably help you implement it in Pytorch). The opposite\nis the *static* tool kit, which includes Theano, Keras, TensorFlow, etc.\nThe core difference is the following: \n\n* In a static toolkit, you define\n  a computation graph once, compile it, and then stream instances to it.\n* In a dynamic toolkit, you define a computation graph *for each\n  instance*. It is never compiled and is executed on-the-fly\n\nWithout a lot of experience, it is difficult to appreciate the\ndifference. One example is to suppose we want to build a deep\nconstituent parser. Suppose our model involves roughly the following\nsteps: \n\n* We build the tree bottom up \n* Tag the root nodes (the words of the sentence) \n* From there, use a neural network and the embeddings\n\nof the words to find combinations that form constituents. Whenever you\nform a new constituent, use some sort of technique to get an embedding\nof the constituent. In this case, our network architecture will depend\ncompletely on the input sentence. In the sentence \"The green cat\nscratched the wall\", at some point in the model, we will want to combine\nthe span $(i,j,r) = (1, 3, \\text{NP})$ (that is, an NP constituent\nspans word 1 to word 3, in this case \"The green cat\").\n\nHowever, another sentence might be \"Somewhere, the big fat cat scratched\nthe wall\". In this sentence, we will want to form the constituent\n$(2, 4, NP)$ at some point. The constituents we will want to form\nwill depend on the instance. If we just compile the computation graph\nonce, as in a static toolkit, it will be exceptionally difficult or\nimpossible to program this logic. In a dynamic toolkit though, there\nisn't just 1 pre-defined computation graph. There can be a new\ncomputation graph for each instance, so this problem goes away.\n\nDynamic toolkits also have the advantage of being easier to debug and\nthe code more closely resembling the host language (by that I mean that\nPytorch and Dynet look more like actual Python code than Keras or\nTheano).\n\n\n"

        "Bi-LSTM Conditional Random Field Discussion\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFor this section, we will see a full, complicated example of a Bi-LSTM\nConditional Random Field for named-entity recognition. The LSTM tagger\nabove is typically sufficient for part-of-speech tagging, but a sequence\nmodel like the CRF is really essential for strong performance on NER.\nFamiliarity with CRF's is assumed. Although this name sounds scary, all\nthe model is is a CRF but where an LSTM provides the features. This is\nan advanced model though, far more complicated than any earlier model in\nthis tutorial. If you want to skip it, that is fine. To see if you're\nready, see if you can:\n\n-  Write the recurrence for the viterbi variable at step i for tag k.\n-  Modify the above recurrence to compute the forward variables instead.\n-  Modify again the above recurrence to compute the forward variables in\n   log-space (hint: log-sum-exp)\n\nIf you can do those three things, you should be able to understand the\ncode below. Recall that the CRF computes a conditional probability. Let\n$y$ be a tag sequence and $x$ an input sequence of words.\nThen we compute\n\n\\begin{align}P(y|x) = \\frac{\\exp{(\\text{Score}(x, y)})}{\\sum_{y'} \\exp{(\\text{Score}(x, y')})}\\end{align}\n\nWhere the score is determined by defining some log potentials\n$\\log \\psi_i(x,y)$ such that\n\n\\begin{align}\\text{Score}(x,y) = \\sum_i \\log \\psi_i(x,y)\\end{align}\n\nTo make the partition function tractable, the potentials must look only\nat local features.\n\nIn the Bi-LSTM CRF, we define two kinds of potentials: emission and\ntransition. The emission potential for the word at index $i$ comes\nfrom the hidden state of the Bi-LSTM at timestep $i$. The\ntransition scores are stored in a $|T|x|T|$ matrix\n$\\textbf{P}$, where $T$ is the tag set. In my\nimplementation, $\\textbf{P}_{j,k}$ is the score of transitioning\nto tag $j$ from tag $k$. So:\n\n\\begin{align}\\text{Score}(x,y) = \\sum_i \\log \\psi_\\text{EMIT}(y_i \\rightarrow x_i) + \\log \\psi_\\text{TRANS}(y_{i-1} \\rightarrow y_i)\\end{align}\n\n\\begin{align}= \\sum_i h_i[y_i] + \\textbf{P}_{y_i, y_{i-1}}\\end{align}\n\nwhere in this second expression, we think of the tags as being assigned\nunique non-negative indices.\n\nIf the above discussion was too brief, you can check out\n`this <http://www.cs.columbia.edu/%7Emcollins/crf.pdf>`__ write up from\nMichael Collins on CRFs.\n\nImplementation Notes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe example below implements the forward algorithm in log space to\ncompute the partition function, and the viterbi algorithm to decode.\nBackpropagation will compute the gradients automatically for us. We\ndon't have to do anything by hand.\n\nThe implementation is not optimized. If you understand what is going on,\nyou'll probably quickly see that iterating over the next tag in the\nforward algorithm could probably be done in one big operation. I wanted\nto code to be more readable. If you want to make the relevant change,\nyou could probably use this tagger for real tasks.\n\n\n"

        "Exercise: A new loss function for discriminative tagging\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt wasn't really necessary for us to create a computation graph when\ndoing decoding, since we do not backpropagate from the viterbi path\nscore. Since we have it anyway, try training the tagger where the loss\nfunction is the difference between the Viterbi path score and the score\nof the gold-standard path. It should be clear that this function is\nnon-negative and 0 when the predicted tag sequence is the correct tag\nsequence. This is essentially *structured perceptron*.\n\nThis modification should be short, since Viterbi and score\\_sentence are\nalready implemented. This is an example of the shape of the computation\ngraph *depending on the training instance*. Although I haven't tried\nimplementing this in a static toolkit, I imagine that it is possible but\nmuch less straightforward.\n\nPick up some real data and do a comparison!\n\n\n"

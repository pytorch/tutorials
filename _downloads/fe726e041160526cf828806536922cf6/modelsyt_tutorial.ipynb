This is the PyTorch base class meant\nto encapsulate behaviors specific to PyTorch Models and their\ncomponents.\n\nOne important behavior of ``torch.nn.Module`` is registering parameters.\nIf a particular ``Module`` subclass has learning weights, these weights\nare expressed as instances of ``torch.nn.Parameter``. The ``Parameter``\nclass is a subclass of ``torch.Tensor``, with the special behavior that\nwhen they are assigned as attributes of a ``Module``, they are added to\nthe list of that modules parameters. These parameters may be accessed\nthrough the ``parameters()`` method on the ``Module`` class.\n\nAs a simple example, here\u2019s a very simple model with two linear layers\nand an activation function. We\u2019ll create an instance of it and ask it to\nreport on its parameters:\n"

This is a layer where every input influences every\noutput of the layer to a degree specified by the layer\u2019s weights. If a\nmodel has *m* inputs and *n* outputs, the weights will be an *m* x *n*\nmatrix. For example:\n\n\n"

This is a default behavior for ``Parameter``\nthat differs from ``Tensor``.\n\nLinear layers are used widely in deep learning models. One of the most\ncommon places you\u2019ll see them is in classifier models, which will\nusually have one or more linear layers at the end, where the last layer\nwill have *n* outputs, where *n* is the number of classes the classifier\naddresses.\n\nConvolutional Layers\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n*Convolutional* layers are built to handle data with a high degree of\nspatial correlation. They are very commonly used in computer vision,\nwhere they detect close groupings of features which the compose into\nhigher-level features. They pop up in other contexts too - for example,\nin NLP applications, where a word\u2019s immediate context (that is, the\nother words nearby in the sequence) can affect the meaning of a\nsentence.\n\nWe saw convolutional layers in action in LeNet5 in an earlier video:\n\n\n"

        "Let\u2019s break down what\u2019s happening in the convolutional layers of this\nmodel. Starting with ``conv1``:\n\n-  LeNet5 is meant to take in a 1x32x32 black & white image. **The first\n   argument to a convolutional layer\u2019s constructor is the number of\n   input channels.** Here, it is 1. If we were building this model to\n   look at 3-color channels, it would be 3.\n-  A convolutional layer is like a window that scans over the image,\n   looking for a pattern it recognizes. These patterns are called\n   *features,* and one of the parameters of a convolutional layer is the\n   number of features we would like it to learn. **This is the second\n   argument to the constructor is the number of output features.** Here,\n   we\u2019re asking our layer to learn 6 features.\n-  Just above, I likened the convolutional layer to a window - but how\n   big is the window? **The third argument is the window or kernel\n   size.** Here, the \u201c5\u201d means we\u2019ve chosen a 5x5 kernel. (If you want a\n   kernel with height different from width, you can specify a tuple for\n   this argument - e.g., ``(3, 5)`` to get a 3x5 convolution kernel.)\n\nThe output of a convolutional layer is an *activation map* - a spatial\nrepresentation of the presence of features in the input tensor.\n``conv1`` will give us an output tensor of 6x28x28; 6 is the number of\nfeatures, and 28 is the height and width of our map. (The 28 comes from\nthe fact that when scanning a 5-pixel window over a 32-pixel row, there\nare only 28 valid positions.)\n\nWe then pass the output of the convolution through a ReLU activation\nfunction (more on activation functions later), then through a max\npooling layer. The max pooling layer takes features near each other in\nthe activation map and groups them together. It does this by reducing\nthe tensor, merging every 2x2 group of cells in the output into a single\ncell, and assigning that cell the maximum value of the 4 cells that went\ninto it. This gives us a lower-resolution version of the activation map,\nwith dimensions 6x14x14.\n\nOur next convolutional layer, ``conv2``, expects 6 input channels\n(corresponding to the 6 features sought by the first layer), has 16\noutput channels, and a 3x3 kernel. It puts out a 16x12x12 activation\nmap, which is again reduced by a max pooling layer to 16x6x6. Prior to\npassing this output to the linear layers, it is reshaped to a 16 \\* 6 \\*\n6 = 576-element vector for consumption by the next layer.\n\nThere are convolutional layers for addressing 1D, 2D, and 3D tensors.\nThere are also many more optional arguments for a conv layer\nconstructor, including stride length(e.g., only scanning every second or\nevery third position) in the input, padding (so you can scan out to the\nedges of the input), and more. See the\n`documentation <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#convolution-layers>`__\nfor more information.\n\nRecurrent Layers\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n*Recurrent neural networks* (or *RNNs)* are used for sequential data -\nanything from time-series measurements from a scientific instrument to\nnatural language sentences to DNA nucleotides. An RNN does this by\nmaintaining a *hidden state* that acts as a sort of memory for what it\nhas seen in the sequence so far.\n\nThe internal structure of an RNN layer - or its variants, the LSTM (long\nshort-term memory) and GRU (gated recurrent unit) - is moderately\ncomplex and beyond the scope of this video, but we\u2019ll show you what one\nlooks like in action with an LSTM-based part-of-speech tagger (a type of\nclassifier that tells you if a word is a noun, verb, etc.):\n\n\n"

The ``torch.nn.Transformer`` class also has classes to\nencapsulate the individual components (``TransformerEncoder``,\n``TransformerDecoder``) and subcomponents (``TransformerEncoderLayer``,\n``TransformerDecoderLayer``).

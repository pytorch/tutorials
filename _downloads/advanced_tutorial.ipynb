        "\nAdvanced: Making Dynamic Decisions and the Bi-LSTM CRF\n======================================================\n\nDynamic versus Static Deep Learning Toolkits\n--------------------------------------------\n\nPytorch is a *dynamic* neural network kit. Another example of a dynamic\nkit is `Dynet <https://github.com/clab/dynet>`__ (I mention this because\nworking with Pytorch and Dynet is similar. If you see an example in\nDynet, it will probably help you implement it in Pytorch). The opposite\nis the *static* tool kit, which includes Theano, Keras, TensorFlow, etc.\nThe core difference is the following:\n\n* In a static toolkit, you define\n  a computation graph once, compile it, and then stream instances to it.\n* In a dynamic toolkit, you define a computation graph *for each\n  instance*. It is never compiled and is executed on-the-fly\n\nWithout a lot of experience, it is difficult to appreciate the\ndifference. One example is to suppose we want to build a deep\nconstituent parser. Suppose our model involves roughly the following\nsteps:\n\n* We build the tree bottom up\n* Tag the root nodes (the words of the sentence)\n* From there, use a neural network and the embeddings\n  of the words to find combinations that form constituents. Whenever you\n  form a new constituent, use some sort of technique to get an embedding\n  of the constituent. In this case, our network architecture will depend\n  completely on the input sentence. In the sentence \"The green cat\n  scratched the wall\", at some point in the model, we will want to combine\n  the span $(i,j,r) = (1, 3, \\text{NP})$ (that is, an NP constituent\n  spans word 1 to word 3, in this case \"The green cat\").\n\nHowever, another sentence might be \"Somewhere, the big fat cat scratched\nthe wall\". In this sentence, we will want to form the constituent\n$(2, 4, NP)$ at some point. The constituents we will want to form\nwill depend on the instance. If we just compile the computation graph\nonce, as in a static toolkit, it will be exceptionally difficult or\nimpossible to program this logic. In a dynamic toolkit though, there\nisn't just 1 pre-defined computation graph. There can be a new\ncomputation graph for each instance, so this problem goes away.\n\nDynamic toolkits also have the advantage of being easier to debug and\nthe code more closely resembling the host language (by that I mean that\nPytorch and Dynet look more like actual Python code than Keras or\nTheano).\n\nBi-LSTM Conditional Random Field Discussion\n-------------------------------------------\n\nFor this section, we will see a full, complicated example of a Bi-LSTM\nConditional Random Field for named-entity recognition. The LSTM tagger\nabove is typically sufficient for part-of-speech tagging, but a sequence\nmodel like the CRF is really essential for strong performance on NER.\nFamiliarity with CRF's is assumed. Although this name sounds scary, all\nthe model is is a CRF but where an LSTM provides the features. This is\nan advanced model though, far more complicated than any earlier model in\nthis tutorial. If you want to skip it, that is fine. To see if you're\nready, see if you can:\n\n-  Write the recurrence for the viterbi variable at step i for tag k.\n-  Modify the above recurrence to compute the forward variables instead.\n-  Modify again the above recurrence to compute the forward variables in\n   log-space (hint: log-sum-exp)\n\nIf you can do those three things, you should be able to understand the\ncode below. Recall that the CRF computes a conditional probability. Let\n$y$ be a tag sequence and $x$ an input sequence of words.\nThen we compute\n\n\\begin{align}P(y|x) = \\frac{\\exp{(\\text{Score}(x, y)})}{\\sum_{y'} \\exp{(\\text{Score}(x, y')})}\\end{align}\n\nWhere the score is determined by defining some log potentials\n$\\log \\psi_i(x,y)$ such that\n\n\\begin{align}\\text{Score}(x,y) = \\sum_i \\log \\psi_i(x,y)\\end{align}\n\nTo make the partition function tractable, the potentials must look only\nat local features.\n\nIn the Bi-LSTM CRF, we define two kinds of potentials: emission and\ntransition. The emission potential for the word at index $i$ comes\nfrom the hidden state of the Bi-LSTM at timestep $i$. The\ntransition scores are stored in a $|T|x|T|$ matrix\n$\\textbf{P}$, where $T$ is the tag set. In my\nimplementation, $\\textbf{P}_{j,k}$ is the score of transitioning\nto tag $j$ from tag $k$. So:\n\n\\begin{align}\\text{Score}(x,y) = \\sum_i \\log \\psi_\\text{EMIT}(y_i \\rightarrow x_i) + \\log \\psi_\\text{TRANS}(y_{i-1} \\rightarrow y_i)\\end{align}\n\n\\begin{align}= \\sum_i h_i[y_i] + \\textbf{P}_{y_i, y_{i-1}}\\end{align}\n\nwhere in this second expression, we think of the tags as being assigned\nunique non-negative indices.\n\nIf the above discussion was too brief, you can check out\n`this <http://www.cs.columbia.edu/%7Emcollins/crf.pdf>`__ write up from\nMichael Collins on CRFs.\n\nImplementation Notes\n--------------------\n\nThe example below implements the forward algorithm in log space to\ncompute the partition function, and the viterbi algorithm to decode.\nBackpropagation will compute the gradients automatically for us. We\ndon't have to do anything by hand.\n\nThe implementation is not optimized. If you understand what is going on,\nyou'll probably quickly see that iterating over the next tag in the\nforward algorithm could probably be done in one big operation. I wanted\nto code to be more readable. If you want to make the relevant change,\nyou could probably use this tagger for real tasks.\n\n"

        "\nAdversarial Example Generation\n==============================\n\n**Author:** `Nathan Inkawhich <https://github.com/inkawhich>`__\n\nIf you are reading this, hopefully you can appreciate how effective some\nmachine learning models are. Research is constantly pushing ML models to\nbe faster, more accurate, and more efficient. However, an often\noverlooked aspect of designing and training models is security and\nrobustness, especially in the face of an adversary who wishes to fool\nthe model.\n\nThis tutorial will raise your awareness to the security vulnerabilities\nof ML models, and will give insight into the hot topic of adversarial\nmachine learning. You may be surprised to find that adding imperceptible\nperturbations to an image *can* cause drastically different model\nperformance. Given that this is a tutorial, we will explore the topic\nvia example on an image classifier. Specifically we will use one of the\nfirst and most popular attack methods, the Fast Gradient Sign Attack\n(FGSM), to fool an MNIST classifier.\n\n\n"

        "Threat Model\n------------\n\nFor context, there are many categories of adversarial attacks, each with\na different goal and assumption of the attacker\u2019s knowledge. However, in\ngeneral the overarching goal is to add the least amount of perturbation\nto the input data to cause the desired misclassification. There are\nseveral kinds of assumptions of the attacker\u2019s knowledge, two of which\nare: **white-box** and **black-box**. A *white-box* attack assumes the\nattacker has full knowledge and access to the model, including\narchitecture, inputs, outputs, and weights. A *black-box* attack assumes\nthe attacker only has access to the inputs and outputs of the model, and\nknows nothing about the underlying architecture or weights. There are\nalso several types of goals, including **misclassification** and\n**source/target misclassification**. A goal of *misclassification* means\nthe adversary only wants the output classification to be wrong but does\nnot care what the new classification is. A *source/target\nmisclassification* means the adversary wants to alter an image that is\noriginally of a specific source class so that it is classified as a\nspecific target class.\n\nIn this case, the FGSM attack is a *white-box* attack with the goal of\n*misclassification*. With this background information, we can now\ndiscuss the attack in detail.\n\nFast Gradient Sign Attack\n-------------------------\n\nOne of the first and most popular adversarial attacks to date is\nreferred to as the *Fast Gradient Sign Attack (FGSM)* and is described\nby Goodfellow et. al.\u00a0in `Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial\nExamples <https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572>`__. The attack is remarkably\npowerful, and yet intuitive. It is designed to attack neural networks by\nleveraging the way they learn, *gradients*. The idea is simple, rather\nthan working to minimize the loss by adjusting the weights based on the\nbackpropagated gradients, the attack *adjusts the input data to maximize\nthe loss* based on the same backpropagated gradients. In other words,\nthe attack uses the gradient of the loss w.r.t the input data, then\nadjusts the input data to maximize the loss.\n\nBefore we jump into the code, let\u2019s look at the famous\n`FGSM <https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572>`__ panda example and extract\nsome notation.\n\n.. figure:: /_static/img/fgsm_panda_image.png\n   :alt: fgsm_panda_image\n\nFrom the figure, $\\mathbf{x}$ is the original input image\ncorrectly classified as a \u201cpanda\u201d, $y$ is the ground truth label\nfor $\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{\\theta}$ represents the model\nparameters, and $J(\\mathbf{\\theta}, \\mathbf{x}, y)$ is the loss\nthat is used to train the network. The attack backpropagates the\ngradient back to the input data to calculate\n$\\nabla_{x} J(\\mathbf{\\theta}, \\mathbf{x}, y)$. Then, it adjusts\nthe input data by a small step ($\\epsilon$ or $0.007$ in the\npicture) in the direction (i.e.\n$sign(\\nabla_{x} J(\\mathbf{\\theta}, \\mathbf{x}, y))$) that will\nmaximize the loss. The resulting perturbed image, $x'$, is then\n*misclassified* by the target network as a \u201cgibbon\u201d when it is still\nclearly a \u201cpanda\u201d.\n\nHopefully now the motivation for this tutorial is clear, so lets jump\ninto the implementation.\n\n\n"

It is\n   important to keep 0 in the list because it represents the model\n   performance on the original test set. Also, intuitively we would\n   expect the larger the epsilon, the more noticeable the perturbations\n   but the more effective the attack in terms of degrading model\n   accuracy. Since the data range here is $[0,1]$, no epsilon\n   value should exceed 1.\n\n-  **pretrained_model** - path to the pretrained MNIST model which was\n   trained with\n   `pytorch/examples/mnist <https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/mnist>`__.\n   For simplicity, download the pretrained model `here <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fn83DF14tWmit0RTKWRhPq5uVXt73e0h?usp=sharing>`__.\n\n-  **use_cuda** - boolean flag to use CUDA if desired and available.\n   Note, a GPU with CUDA is not critical for this tutorial as a CPU will\n   not take much time.\n\n\n"

This is not strictly necessary - PyTorch will take a series of\ninitial, unlabeled integer arguments as a tensor shape - but when adding\nthe optional arguments, it can make your intent more readable.\n\nThe other way to set the datatype is with the ``.to()`` method. In the\ncell above, we create a random floating point tensor ``b`` in the usual\nway. Following that, we create ``c`` by converting ``b`` to a 32-bit\ninteger with the ``.to()`` method. Note that ``c`` contains all the same\nvalues as ``b``, but truncated to integers.\n\nAvailable data types include:\n\n-  ``torch.bool``\n-  ``torch.int8``\n-  ``torch.uint8``\n-  ``torch.int16``\n-  ``torch.int32``\n-  ``torch.int64``\n-  ``torch.half``\n-  ``torch.float``\n-  ``torch.double``\n-  ``torch.bfloat``\n\nMath & Logic with PyTorch Tensors\n---------------------------------\n\nNow that you know some of the ways to create a tensor\u2026 what can you do\nwith them?\n\nLet\u2019s look at basic arithmetic first, and how tensors interact with\nsimple scalars:\n\n\n"

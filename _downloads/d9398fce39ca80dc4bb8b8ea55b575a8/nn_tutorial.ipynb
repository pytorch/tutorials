To develop this understanding, we will first train basic neural net\non the MNIST data set without using any features from these models; we will\ninitially only use the most basic PyTorch tensor functionality. Then, we will\nincrementally add one feature from ``torch.nn``, ``torch.optim``, ``Dataset``, or\n``DataLoader`` at a time, showing exactly what each piece does, and how it\nworks to make the code either more concise, or more flexible.\n\n**This tutorial assumes you already have PyTorch installed, and are familiar\nwith the basics of tensor operations.** (If you're familiar with Numpy array\noperations, you'll find the PyTorch tensor operations used here nearly identical).\n\n## MNIST data setup\n\nWe will use the classic [MNIST](http://deeplearning.net/data/mnist/) dataset,\nwhich consists of black-and-white images of hand-drawn digits (between 0 and 9).\n\nWe will use [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)\nfor dealing with paths (part of the Python 3 standard library), and will\ndownload the dataset using\n[requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/).

        "## Closing thoughts\n\nWe now have a general data pipeline and training loop which you can use for\ntraining many types of models using Pytorch. To see how simple training a model\ncan now be, take a look at the [mnist_sample notebook](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_dev/blob/master/dev_nb/mnist_sample.ipynb)_.\n\nOf course, there are many things you'll want to add, such as data augmentation,\nhyperparameter tuning, monitoring training, transfer learning, and so forth.\nThese features are available in the fastai library, which has been developed\nusing the same design approach shown in this tutorial, providing a natural\nnext step for practitioners looking to take their models further.\n\nWe promised at the start of this tutorial we'd explain through example each of\n``torch.nn``, ``torch.optim``, ``Dataset``, and ``DataLoader``. So let's summarize\nwhat we've seen:\n\n - ``torch.nn``:\n\n   + ``Module``: creates a callable which behaves like a function, but can also\n     contain state(such as neural net layer weights). It knows what ``Parameter`` (s) it\n     contains and can zero all their gradients, loop through them for weight updates, etc.\n   + ``Parameter``: a wrapper for a tensor that tells a ``Module`` that it has weights\n     that need updating during backprop. Only tensors with the `requires_grad` attribute set are updated\n   + ``functional``: a module(usually imported into the ``F`` namespace by convention)\n     which contains activation functions, loss functions, etc, as well as non-stateful\n     versions of layers such as convolutional and linear layers.\n - ``torch.optim``: Contains optimizers such as ``SGD``, which update the weights\n   of ``Parameter`` during the backward step\n - ``Dataset``: An abstract interface of objects with a ``__len__`` and a ``__getitem__``,\n   including classes provided with Pytorch such as ``TensorDataset``\n - ``DataLoader``: Takes any ``Dataset`` and creates an iterator which returns batches of data.\n\n"

Understanding requires_grad, retain_grad, Leaf, and Non-leaf Tensors
====================================================================

**Author:** `Justin Silver <https://github.com/j-silv>`__

This tutorial explains the subtleties of ``requires_grad``,
``retain_grad``, leaf, and non-leaf tensors using a simple example.

Before starting, make sure you understand `tensors and how to manipulate
them <https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/tensorqs_tutorial.html>`__.
A basic knowledge of `how autograd
works <https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/autogradqs_tutorial.html>`__
would also be useful.

# Setup
# -----
#
# First, make sure `PyTorch is
# installed <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`__ and then import
# the necessary libraries.
#

import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F


######################################################################
# Next, we instantiate a simple network to focus on the gradients. This
# will be an affine layer, followed by a ReLU activation, and ending with
# a MSE loss between prediction and label tensors.
#
# .. math::
#
#    \mathbf{y}_{\text{pred}} = \text{ReLU}(\mathbf{x} \mathbf{W} + \mathbf{b})
#
# .. math::
#
#    L = \text{MSE}(\mathbf{y}_{\text{pred}}, \mathbf{y})
#
# Note that the ``requires_grad=True`` is necessary for the parameters
# (``W`` and ``b``) so that PyTorch tracks operations involving those
# tensors. We’ll discuss more about this in a future
# `section <#requires-grad>`__.
#

# tensor setup
x = torch.ones(1, 3)                      # input with shape: (1, 3)
W = torch.ones(3, 2, requires_grad=True)  # weights with shape: (3, 2)
b = torch.ones(1, 2, requires_grad=True)  # bias with shape: (1, 2)
y = torch.ones(1, 2)                      # output with shape: (1, 2)

# forward pass
z = (x @ W) + b                           # pre-activation with shape: (1, 2)
y_pred = F.relu(z)                        # activation with shape: (1, 2)
loss = F.mse_loss(y_pred, y)              # scalar loss


######################################################################
# Leaf vs. non-leaf tensors
# -------------------------
#
# After running the forward pass, PyTorch autograd has built up a `dynamic
# computational
# graph <https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html#computational-graph>`__
# which is shown below. This is a `Directed Acyclic Graph
# (DAG) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph>`__ which
# keeps a record of input tensors (leaf nodes), all subsequent operations
# on those tensors, and the intermediate/output tensors (non-leaf nodes).
# The graph is used to compute gradients for each tensor starting from the
# graph roots (outputs) to the leaves (inputs) using the `chain
# rule <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule>`__ from calculus:
#
# .. math::
#
#    \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{f}_k\bigl(\mathbf{f}_{k-1}(\dots \mathbf{f}_1(\mathbf{x}) \dots)\bigr)
#
# .. math::
#
#    \frac{\partial \mathbf{y}}{\partial \mathbf{x}} =
#    \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}_k}{\partial \mathbf{f}_{k-1}} \cdot
#    \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}_{k-1}}{\partial \mathbf{f}_{k-2}} \cdot
#    \cdots \cdot
#    \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}_1}{\partial \mathbf{x}}
#

#
#    Computational graph after forward pass
#
# PyTorch considers a node to be a *leaf* if it is not the result of a
# tensor operation with at least one input having ``requires_grad=True``
# (e.g. ``x``, ``W``, ``b``, and ``y``), and everything else to be
# *non-leaf* (e.g. ``z``, ``y_pred``, and ``loss``). You can verify this
# programmatically by probing the ``is_leaf`` attribute of the tensors:
#

# prints True because new tensors are leafs by convention
print(f"{x.is_leaf=}")

# prints False because tensor is the result of an operation with at
# least one input having requires_grad=True
print(f"{z.is_leaf=}")


######################################################################
# The distinction between leaf and non-leaf determines whether the
# tensor’s gradient will be stored in the ``grad`` property after the
# backward pass, and thus be usable for `gradient
# descent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent>`__. We’ll cover
# this some more in the `following section <#retain-grad>`__.
#
# Let’s now investigate how PyTorch calculates and stores gradients for
# the tensors in its computational graph.
#


######################################################################
# ``requires_grad``
# -----------------
#
# To build the computational graph which can be used for gradient
# calculation, we need to pass in the ``requires_grad=True`` parameter to
# a tensor constructor. By default, the value is ``False``, and thus
# PyTorch does not track gradients on any created tensors. To verify this,
# try not setting ``requires_grad``, re-run the forward pass, and then run
# backpropagation. You will see:
#
# ::
#
#    >>> loss.backward()
#    RuntimeError: element 0 of tensors does not require grad and does not have a grad_fn
#
# This error means that autograd can’t backpropagate to any leaf tensors
# because ``loss`` is not tracking gradients. If you need to change the
# property, you can call ``requires_grad_()`` on the tensor (notice the \_
# suffix).
#
# We can sanity check which nodes require gradient calculation, just like
# we did above with the ``is_leaf`` attribute:
#

print(f"{x.requires_grad=}") # prints False because requires_grad=False by default
print(f"{W.requires_grad=}") # prints True because we set requires_grad=True in constructor
print(f"{z.requires_grad=}") # prints True because tensor is a non-leaf node


######################################################################
# It’s useful to remember that a non-leaf tensor has
# ``requires_grad=True`` by definition, since backpropagation would fail
# otherwise. If the tensor is a leaf, then it will only have
# ``requires_grad=True`` if it was specifically set by the user. Another
# way to phrase this is that if at least one of the inputs to a tensor
# requires the gradient, then it will require the gradient as well.
#
# There are two exceptions to this rule:
#
# 1. Any ``nn.Module`` that has ``nn.Parameter`` will have
#    ``requires_grad=True`` for its parameters (see
#    `here <https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html#creating-models>`__)
# 2. Locally disabling gradient computation with context managers (see
#    `here <https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/autograd.html#locally-disabling-gradient-computation>`__)
#
# In summary, ``requires_grad`` tells autograd which tensors need to have
# their gradients calculated for backpropagation to work. This is
# different from which tensors have their ``grad`` field populated, which
# is the topic of the next section.
#


######################################################################
# ``retain_grad``
# ---------------
#
# To actually perform optimization (e.g. SGD, Adam, etc.), we need to run
# the backward pass so that we can extract the gradients.
#

loss.backward()


######################################################################
# Calling ``backward()`` populates the ``grad`` field of all leaf tensors
# which had ``requires_grad=True``. The ``grad`` is the gradient of the
# loss with respect to the tensor we are probing. Before running
# ``backward()``, this attribute is set to ``None``.
#

print(f"{W.grad=}")
print(f"{b.grad=}")


######################################################################
# You might be wondering about the other tensors in our network. Let’s
# check the remaining leaf nodes:
#

# prints all None because requires_grad=False
print(f"{x.grad=}")
print(f"{y.grad=}")


######################################################################
# The gradients for these tensors haven’t been populated because we did
# not explicitly tell PyTorch to calculate their gradient
# (``requires_grad=False``).
#
# Let’s now look at an intermediate non-leaf node:
#

print(f"{z.grad=}")


######################################################################
# PyTorch returns ``None`` for the gradient and also warns us that a
# non-leaf node’s ``grad`` attribute is being accessed. Although autograd
# has to calculate intermediate gradients for backpropagation to work, it
# assumes you don’t need to access the values afterwards. To change this
# behavior, we can use the ``retain_grad()`` function on a tensor. This
# tells the autograd engine to populate that tensor’s ``grad`` after
# calling ``backward()``.
#

# we have to re-run the forward pass
z = (x @ W) + b
y_pred = F.relu(z)
loss = F.mse_loss(y_pred, y)

# tell PyTorch to store the gradients after backward()
z.retain_grad()
y_pred.retain_grad()
loss.retain_grad()

# have to zero out gradients otherwise they would accumulate
W.grad = None
b.grad = None

# backpropagation
loss.backward()

# print gradients for all tensors that have requires_grad=True
print(f"{W.grad=}")
print(f"{b.grad=}")
print(f"{z.grad=}")
print(f"{y_pred.grad=}")
print(f"{loss.grad=}")


######################################################################
# We get the same result for ``W.grad`` as before. Also note that because
# the loss is scalar, the gradient of the loss with respect to itself is
# simply ``1.0``.
#
# If we look at the state of the computational graph now, we see that the
# ``retains_grad`` attribute has changed for the intermediate tensors. By
# convention, this attribute will print ``False`` for any leaf node, even
# if it requires its gradient.
#
# .. figure:: /_static/img/understanding_leaf_vs_nonleaf/comp-graph-2.png
#    :alt: Computational graph after backward pass

#    Computational graph after backward pass
#
# If you call ``retain_grad()`` on a non-leaf node, it results in a no-op.
# If we call ``retain_grad()`` on a node that has ``requires_grad=False``,
# PyTorch actually throws an error, since it can’t store the gradient if
# it is never calculated.
#
# ::
#
#    >>> x.retain_grad()
#    RuntimeError: can't retain_grad on Tensor that has requires_grad=False
#


######################################################################
# Summary table
# -------------
#
# Using ``retain_grad()`` and ``retains_grad`` only make sense for
# non-leaf nodes, since the ``grad`` attribute will already be populated
# for leaf tensors that have ``requires_grad=True``. By default, these
# non-leaf nodes do not retain (store) their gradient after
# backpropagation. We can change that by rerunning the forward pass,
# telling PyTorch to store the gradients, and then performing
# backpropagation.
#
# The following table can be used as a reference which summarizes the
# above discussions. The following scenarios are the only ones that are
# valid for PyTorch tensors.

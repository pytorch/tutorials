        "Introduction\n------------\n\nThis tutorial will give an introduction to DCGANs through an example. We\nwill train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate new\ncelebrities after showing it pictures of many real celebrities. Most of\nthe code here is from the dcgan implementation in\n`pytorch/examples <https://github.com/pytorch/examples>`__, and this\ndocument will give a thorough explanation of the implementation and shed\nlight on how and why this model works. But don\u2019t worry, no prior\nknowledge of GANs is required, but it may require a first-timer to spend\nsome time reasoning about what is actually happening under the hood.\nAlso, for the sake of time it will help to have a GPU, or two. Lets\nstart from the beginning.\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks\n-------------------------------\n\nWhat is a GAN?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nGANs are a framework for teaching a DL model to capture the training\ndata\u2019s distribution so we can generate new data from that same\ndistribution. GANs were invented by Ian Goodfellow in 2014 and first\ndescribed in the paper `Generative Adversarial\nNets <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf>`__.\nThey are made of two distinct models, a *generator* and a\n*discriminator*. The job of the generator is to spawn \u2018fake\u2019 images that\nlook like the training images. The job of the discriminator is to look\nat an image and output whether or not it is a real training image or a\nfake image from the generator. During training, the generator is\nconstantly trying to outsmart the discriminator by generating better and\nbetter fakes, while the discriminator is working to become a better\ndetective and correctly classify the real and fake images. The\nequilibrium of this game is when the generator is generating perfect\nfakes that look as if they came directly from the training data, and the\ndiscriminator is left to always guess at 50% confidence that the\ngenerator output is real or fake.\n\nNow, lets define some notation to be used throughout tutorial starting\nwith the discriminator. Let $x$ be data representing an image.\n$D(x)$ is the discriminator network which outputs the (scalar)\nprobability that $x$ came from training data rather than the\ngenerator. Here, since we are dealing with images the input to\n$D(x)$ is an image of HWC size 3x64x64. Intuitively, $D(x)$\nshould be HIGH when $x$ comes from training data and LOW when\n$x$ comes from the generator. $D(x)$ can also be thought of\nas a traditional binary classifier.\n\nFor the generator\u2019s notation, let $z$ be a latent space vector\nsampled from a standard normal distribution. $G(z)$ represents the\ngenerator function which maps the latent vector $z$ to data-space.\nThe goal of $G$ is to estimate the distribution that the training\ndata comes from ($p_{data}$) so it can generate fake samples from\nthat estimated distribution ($p_g$).\n\nSo, $D(G(z))$ is the probability (scalar) that the output of the\ngenerator $G$ is a real image. As described in `Goodfellow\u2019s\npaper <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf>`__,\n$D$ and $G$ play a minimax game in which $D$ tries to\nmaximize the probability it correctly classifies reals and fakes\n($logD(x)$), and $G$ tries to minimize the probability that\n$D$ will predict its outputs are fake ($log(1-D(G(x)))$).\nFrom the paper, the GAN loss function is\n\n\\begin{align}\\underset{G}{\\text{min}} \\underset{D}{\\text{max}}V(D,G) = \\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim p_{data}(x)}\\big[logD(x)\\big] + \\mathbb{E}_{z\\sim p_{z}(z)}\\big[log(1-D(G(x)))\\big]\\end{align}\n\nIn theory, the solution to this minimax game is where\n$p_g = p_{data}$, and the discriminator guesses randomly if the\ninputs are real or fake. However, the convergence theory of GANs is\nstill being actively researched and in reality models do not always\ntrain to this point.\n\nWhat is a DCGAN?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA DCGAN is a direct extension of the GAN described above, except that it\nexplicitly uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers in the\ndiscriminator and generator, respectively. It was first described by\nRadford et. al.\u00a0in the paper `Unsupervised Representation Learning With\nDeep Convolutional Generative Adversarial\nNetworks <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf>`__. The discriminator\nis made up of strided\n`convolution <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Conv2d>`__\nlayers, `batch\nnorm <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.BatchNorm2d>`__\nlayers, and\n`LeakyReLU <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.LeakyReLU>`__\nactivations. The input is a 3x64x64 input image and the output is a\nscalar probability that the input is from the real data distribution.\nThe generator is comprised of\n`convolutional-transpose <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d>`__\nlayers, batch norm layers, and\n`ReLU <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#relu>`__ activations. The\ninput is a latent vector, $z$, that is drawn from a standard\nnormal distribution and the output is a 3x64x64 RGB image. The strided\nconv-transpose layers allow the latent vector to be transformed into a\nvolume with the same shape as an image. In the paper, the authors also\ngive some tips about how to setup the optimizers, how to calculate the\nloss functions, and how to initialize the model weights, all of which\nwill be explained in the coming sections.\n\n\n"

Since our data are images, converting\n$z$ to data-space means ultimately creating a RGB image with the\nsame size as the training images (i.e.\u00a03x64x64).

        "Loss Functions and Optimizers\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWith $D$ and $G$ setup, we can specify how they learn\nthrough the loss functions and optimizers.

We can specify what part of the BCE equation to\nuse with the $y$ input. This is accomplished in the training loop\nwhich is coming up soon, but it is important to understand how we can\nchoose which component we wish to calculate just by changing $y$\n(i.e.\u00a0GT labels).\n\nNext, we define our real label as 1 and the fake label as 0. These\nlabels will be used when calculating the losses of $D$ and\n$G$, and this is also the convention used in the original GAN\npaper. Finally, we set up two separate optimizers, one for $D$ and\none for $G$. As specified in the DCGAN paper, both are Adam\noptimizers with learning rate 0.0002 and Beta1 = 0.5. For keeping track\nof the generator\u2019s learning progression, we will generate a fixed batch\nof latent vectors that are drawn from a Gaussian distribution\n(i.e.\u00a0fixed_noise) . In the training loop, we will periodically input\nthis fixed_noise into $G$, and over the iterations we will see\nimages form out of the noise.\n\n\n"

        "Training\n~~~~~~~~\n\nFinally, now that we have all of the parts of the GAN framework defined,\nwe can train it. Be mindful that training GANs is somewhat of an art\nform, as incorrect hyperparameter settings lead to mode collapse with\nlittle explanation of what went wrong. Here, we will closely follow\nAlgorithm 1 from Goodfellow\u2019s paper, while abiding by some of the best\npractices shown in `ganhacks <https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks>`__.\nNamely, we will \u201cconstruct different mini-batches for real and fake\u201d\nimages, and also adjust G\u2019s objective function to maximize\n$logD(G(z))$. Training is split up into two main parts. Part 1\nupdates the Discriminator and Part 2 updates the Generator.\n\n**Part 1 - Train the Discriminator**\n\nRecall, the goal of training the discriminator is to maximize the\nprobability of correctly classifying a given input as real or fake. In\nterms of Goodfellow, we wish to \u201cupdate the discriminator by ascending\nits stochastic gradient\u201d. Practically, we want to maximize\n$log(D(x)) + log(1-D(G(z)))$. Due to the separate mini-batch\nsuggestion from ganhacks, we will calculate this in two steps. First, we\nwill construct a batch of real samples from the training set, forward\npass through $D$, calculate the loss ($log(D(x))$), then\ncalculate the gradients in a backward pass. Secondly, we will construct\na batch of fake samples with the current generator, forward pass this\nbatch through $D$, calculate the loss ($log(1-D(G(z)))$),\nand *accumulate* the gradients with a backward pass. Now, with the\ngradients accumulated from both the all-real and all-fake batches, we\ncall a step of the Discriminator\u2019s optimizer.\n\n**Part 2 - Train the Generator**\n\nAs stated in the original paper, we want to train the Generator by\nminimizing $log(1-D(G(z)))$ in an effort to generate better fakes.\nAs mentioned, this was shown by Goodfellow to not provide sufficient\ngradients, especially early in the learning process. As a fix, we\ninstead wish to maximize $log(D(G(z)))$. In the code we accomplish\nthis by: classifying the Generator output from Part 1 with the\nDiscriminator, computing G\u2019s loss *using real labels as GT*, computing\nG\u2019s gradients in a backward pass, and finally updating G\u2019s parameters\nwith an optimizer step. It may seem counter-intuitive to use the real\nlabels as GT labels for the loss function, but this allows us to use the\n$log(x)$ part of the BCELoss (rather than the $log(1-x)$\npart) which is exactly what we want.\n\nFinally, we will do some statistic reporting and at the end of each\nepoch we will push our fixed_noise batch through the generator to\nvisually track the progress of G\u2019s training. The training statistics\nreported are:\n\n-  **Loss_D** - discriminator loss calculated as the sum of losses for\n   the all real and all fake batches ($log(D(x)) + log(D(G(z)))$).\n-  **Loss_G** - generator loss calculated as $log(D(G(z)))$\n-  **D(x)** - the average output (across the batch) of the discriminator\n   for the all real batch. This should start close to 1 then\n   theoretically converge to 0.5 when G gets better. Think about why\n   this is.\n-  **D(G(z))** - average discriminator outputs for the all fake batch.\n   The first number is before D is updated and the second number is\n   after D is updated. These numbers should start near 0 and converge to\n   0.5 as G gets better. Think about why this is.\n\n**Note:** This step might take a while, depending on how many epochs you\nrun and if you removed some data from the dataset.\n\n\n"

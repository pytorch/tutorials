        "This tutorial will walk through the process of transitioning a\nsequence-to-sequence model to Torch Script using PyTorch\u2019s Hybrid\nFrontend. The model that we will convert is the chatbot model from the\n`Chatbot tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/chatbot_tutorial.html>`__. \nYou can either treat this tutorial as a \u201cPart 2\u201d to the Chatbot tutorial\nand deploy your own pretrained model, or you can start with this\ndocument and use a pretrained model that we host. In the latter case,\nyou can reference the original Chatbot tutorial for details\nregarding data preprocessing, model theory and definition, and model\ntraining.\n\n.. attention:: This example requires PyTorch 1.0 (preview) or later.\n   For installation information visit http://pytorch.org/get-started.\n\nWhat is the Hybrid Frontend?\n----------------------------\n\nDuring the research and development phase of a deep learning-based\nproject, it is advantageous to interact with an **eager**, imperative\ninterface like PyTorch\u2019s. This gives users the ability to write\nfamiliar, idiomatic Python, allowing for the use of Python data\nstructures, control flow operations, print statements, and debugging\nutilities. Although the eager interface is a beneficial tool for\nresearch and experimentation applications, when it comes time to deploy\nthe model in a production environment, having a **graph**-based model\nrepresentation is very beneficial. A deferred graph representation\nallows for optimizations such as out-of-order execution, and the ability\nto target highly optimized hardware architectures. Also, a graph-based\nrepresentation enables framework-agnostic model exportation. PyTorch\nprovides mechanisms for incrementally converting eager-mode code into\nTorch Script, a statically analyzable and optimizable subset of Python\nthat Torch uses to represent deep learning programs independently from\nthe Python runtime.\n\nThe API for converting eager-mode PyTorch programs into Torch Script is\nfound in the torch.jit module. This module has two core modalities for\nconverting an eager-mode model to a Torch Script graph representation:\n**tracing** and **scripting**. The ``torch.jit.trace`` function takes a\nmodule or function and a set of example inputs. It then runs the example\ninput through the function or module while tracing the computational\nsteps that are encountered, and outputs a graph-based function that\nperforms the traced operations. **Tracing** is great for straightforward\nmodules and functions that do not involve data-dependent control flow,\nsuch as standard convolutional neural networks. However, if a function\nwith data-dependent if statements and loops is traced, only the\noperations called along the execution route taken by the example input\nwill be recorded. In other words, the control flow itself is not\ncaptured. To convert modules and functions containing data-dependent\ncontrol flow, a **scripting** mechanism is provided. Scripting\nexplicitly converts the module or function code to Torch Script,\nincluding all possible control flow routes. To use script mode, be sure\nto inherit from the the ``torch.jit.ScriptModule`` base class (instead\nof ``torch.nn.Module``) and add a ``torch.jit.script`` decorator to your\nPython function or a ``torch.jit.script_method`` decorator to your\nmodule\u2019s methods. The one caveat with using scripting is that it only\nsupports a restricted subset of Python. For all details relating to the\nsupported features, see the Torch Script `language\nreference <https://pytorch.org/docs/master/jit.html>`__. To provide the\nmaximum flexibility, the modes of Torch Script can be composed to\nrepresent your whole program, and these techniques can be applied\nincrementally.\n\n.. figure:: /_static/img/chatbot/pytorch_workflow.png\n   :align: center\n   :alt: workflow\n\n\n"

        "Model Overview\n--------------\n\nAs mentioned, the model that we are using is a\n`sequence-to-sequence <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__ (seq2seq)\nmodel. This type of model is used in cases when our input is a\nvariable-length sequence, and our output is also a variable length\nsequence that is not necessarily a one-to-one mapping of the input. A\nseq2seq model is comprised of two recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that\nwork cooperatively: an **encoder** and a **decoder**.\n\n.. figure:: /_static/img/chatbot/seq2seq_ts.png\n   :align: center\n   :alt: model\n\n\nImage source:\nhttps://jeddy92.github.io/JEddy92.github.io/ts_seq2seq_intro/\n\nEncoder\n~~~~~~~\n\nThe encoder RNN iterates through the input sentence one token\n(e.g.\u00a0word) at a time, at each time step outputting an \u201coutput\u201d vector\nand a \u201chidden state\u201d vector. The hidden state vector is then passed to\nthe next time step, while the output vector is recorded. The encoder\ntransforms the context it saw at each point in the sequence into a set\nof points in a high-dimensional space, which the decoder will use to\ngenerate a meaningful output for the given task.\n\nDecoder\n~~~~~~~\n\nThe decoder RNN generates the response sentence in a token-by-token\nfashion. It uses the encoder\u2019s context vectors, and internal hidden\nstates to generate the next word in the sequence. It continues\ngenerating words until it outputs an *EOS_token*, representing the end\nof the sentence. We use an `attention\nmechanism <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`__ in our decoder to help it\nto \u201cpay attention\u201d to certain parts of the input when generating the\noutput. For our model, we implement `Luong et\nal. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025>`__\\ \u2019s \u201cGlobal attention\u201d module,\nand use it as a submodule in our decode model.\n\n\n"

        "Data Handling\n-------------\n\nAlthough our models conceptually deal with sequences of tokens, in\nreality, they deal with numbers like all machine learning models do. In\nthis case, every word in the model\u2019s vocabulary, which was established\nbefore training, is mapped to an integer index. We use a ``Voc`` object\nto contain the mappings from word to index, as well as the total number\nof words in the vocabulary. We will load the object later before we run\nthe model.\n\nAlso, in order for us to be able to run evaluations, we must provide a\ntool for processing our string inputs. The ``normalizeString`` function\nconverts all characters in a string to lowercase and removes all\nnon-letter characters. The ``indexesFromSentence`` function takes a\nsentence of words and returns the corresponding sequence of word\nindexes.\n\n\n"

        "Define Encoder\n--------------\n\nWe implement our encoder\u2019s RNN with the ``torch.nn.GRU`` module which we\nfeed a batch of sentences (vectors of word embeddings) and it internally\niterates through the sentences one token at a time calculating the\nhidden states. We initialize this module to be bidirectional, meaning\nthat we have two independent GRUs: one that iterates through the\nsequences in chronological order, and another that iterates in reverse\norder. We ultimately return the sum of these two GRUs\u2019 outputs. Since\nour model was trained using batching, our ``EncoderRNN`` model\u2019s\n``forward`` function expects a padded input batch. To batch\nvariable-length sentences, we allow a maximum of *MAX_LENGTH* tokens in\na sentence, and all sentences in the batch that have less than\n*MAX_LENGTH* tokens are padded at the end with our dedicated *PAD_token*\ntokens. To use padded batches with a PyTorch RNN module, we must wrap\nthe forward pass call with ``torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence``\nand ``torch.nn.utils.rnn.pad_packed_sequence`` data transformations.\nNote that the ``forward`` function also takes an ``input_lengths`` list,\nwhich contains the length of each sentence in the batch.

        "Define Evaluation\n-----------------\n\nGreedy Search Decoder\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAs in the chatbot tutorial, we use a ``GreedySearchDecoder`` module to\nfacilitate the actual decoding process. This module has the trained\nencoder and decoder models as attributes, and drives the process of\nencoding an input sentence (a vector of word indexes), and iteratively\ndecoding an output response sequence one word (word index) at a time.\n\nEncoding the input sequence is straightforward: simply forward the\nentire sequence tensor and its corresponding lengths vector to the\n``encoder``. It is important to note that this module only deals with\none input sequence at a time, **NOT** batches of sequences. Therefore,\nwhen the constant **1** is used for declaring tensor sizes, this\ncorresponds to a batch size of 1. To decode a given decoder output, we\nmust iteratively run forward passes through our decoder model, which\noutputs softmax scores corresponding to the probability of each word\nbeing the correct next word in the decoded sequence. We initialize the\n``decoder_input`` to a tensor containing an *SOS_token*. After each pass\nthrough the ``decoder``, we *greedily* append the word with the highest\nsoftmax probability to the ``decoded_words`` list. We also use this word\nas the ``decoder_input`` for the next iteration. The decoding process\nterminates either if the ``decoded_words`` list has reached a length of\n*MAX_LENGTH* or if the predicted word is the *EOS_token*.\n\nHybrid Frontend Notes:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe ``forward`` method of this module involves iterating over the range\nof $[0, max\\_length)$ when decoding an output sequence one word at\na time. Because of this, we should use **scripting** to convert this\nmodule to Torch Script. Unlike with our encoder and decoder models,\nwhich we can trace, we must make some necessary changes to the\n``GreedySearchDecoder`` module in order to initialize an object without\nerror. In other words, we must ensure that our module adheres to the\nrules of the scripting mechanism, and does not utilize any language\nfeatures outside of the subset of Python that Torch Script includes.\n\nTo get an idea of some manipulations that may be required, we will go\nover the diffs between the ``GreedySearchDecoder`` implementation from\nthe chatbot tutorial and the implementation that we use in the cell\nbelow. Note that the lines highlighted in red are lines removed from the\noriginal implementation and the lines highlighted in green are new.\n\n.. figure:: /_static/img/chatbot/diff.png\n   :align: center\n   :alt: diff\n\nChanges:\n^^^^^^^^\n\n-  ``nn.Module`` -> ``torch.jit.ScriptModule``\n\n   -  In order to use PyTorch\u2019s scripting mechanism on a module, that\n      module must inherit from the ``torch.jit.ScriptModule``.\n\n\n-  Added ``decoder_n_layers`` to the constructor arguments\n\n   -  This change stems from the fact that the encoder and decoder\n      models that we pass to this module will be a child of\n      ``TracedModule`` (not ``Module``). Therefore, we cannot access the\n      decoder\u2019s number of layers with ``decoder.n_layers``. Instead, we\n      plan for this, and pass this value in during module construction.\n\n\n-  Store away new attributes as constants\n\n   -  In the original implementation, we were free to use variables from\n      the surrounding (global) scope in our ``GreedySearchDecoder``\\ \u2019s\n      ``forward`` method. However, now that we are using scripting, we\n      do not have this freedom, as the assumption with scripting is that\n      we cannot necessarily hold on to Python objects, especially when\n      exporting. An easy solution to this is to store these values from\n      the global scope as attributes to the module in the constructor,\n      and add them to a special list called ``__constants__`` so that\n      they can be used as literal values when constructing the graph in\n      the ``forward`` method. An example of this usage is on NEW line\n      19, where instead of using the ``device`` and ``SOS_token`` global\n      values, we use our constant attributes ``self._device`` and\n      ``self._SOS_token``.\n\n\n-  Add the ``torch.jit.script_method`` decorator to the ``forward``\n   method\n\n   -  Adding this decorator lets the JIT compiler know that the function\n      that it is decorating should be scripted.\n\n\n-  Enforce types of ``forward`` method arguments\n\n   -  By default, all parameters to a Torch Script function are assumed\n      to be Tensor. If we need to pass an argument of a different type,\n      we can use function type annotations as introduced in `PEP\n      3107 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/>`__. In addition,\n      it is possible to declare arguments of different types using\n      MyPy-style type annotations (see\n      `doc <https://pytorch.org/docs/master/jit.html#types>`__).\n\n\n-  Change initialization of ``decoder_input``\n\n   -  In the original implementation, we initialized our\n      ``decoder_input`` tensor with ``torch.LongTensor([[SOS_token]])``.\n      When scripting, we are not allowed to initialize tensors in a\n      literal fashion like this. Instead, we can initialize our tensor\n      with an explicit torch function such as ``torch.ones``. In this\n      case, we can easily replicate the scalar ``decoder_input`` tensor\n      by multiplying 1 by our SOS_token value stored in the constant\n      ``self._SOS_token``.\n\n\n"

        "Evaluating an Input\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNext, we define some functions for evaluating an input.

        "Convert Model to Torch Script\n-----------------------------\n\nEncoder\n~~~~~~~\n\nAs previously mentioned, to convert the encoder model to Torch Script,\nwe use **tracing**. Tracing any module requires running an example input\nthrough the model\u2019s ``forward`` method and trace the computational graph\nthat the data encounters. The encoder model takes an input sequence and\na corresponding lengths tensor. Therefore, we create an example input\nsequence tensor ``test_seq``, which is of appropriate size (MAX_LENGTH,\n1), contains numbers in the appropriate range\n$[0, voc.num\\_words)$, and is of the appropriate type (int64). We\nalso create a ``test_seq_length`` scalar which realistically contains\nthe value corresponding to how many words are in the ``test_seq``. The\nnext step is to use the ``torch.jit.trace`` function to trace the model.\nNotice that the first argument we pass is the module that we want to\ntrace, and the second is a tuple of arguments to the module\u2019s\n``forward`` method.\n\nDecoder\n~~~~~~~\n\nWe perform the same process for tracing the decoder as we did for the\nencoder. Notice that we call forward on a set of random inputs to the\ntraced_encoder to get the output that we need for the decoder. This is\nnot required, as we could also simply manufacture a tensor of the\ncorrect shape, type, and value range. This method is possible because in\nour case we do not have any constraints on the values of the tensors\nbecause we do not have any operations that could fault on out-of-range\ninputs.\n\nGreedySearchDecoder\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nRecall that we scripted our searcher module due to the presence of\ndata-dependent control flow. In the case of scripting, we do the\nconversion work up front by adding the decorator and making sure the\nimplementation complies with scripting rules.

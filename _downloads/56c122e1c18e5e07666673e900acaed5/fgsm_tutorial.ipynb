    "general the overarching goal is to add the least amount of perturbation\n",
    "to the input data to cause the desired misclassification. There are\n",

    "are: **white-box** and **black-box**. A *white-box* attack assumes the\n",

    "architecture, inputs, outputs, and weights. A *black-box* attack assumes\n",

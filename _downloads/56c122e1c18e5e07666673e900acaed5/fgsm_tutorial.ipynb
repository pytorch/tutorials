    "general the overarching goal is to add the least amount of perturbation\n",
    "to the input data to cause the desired misclassification. There are\n",
    "several kinds of assumptions of the attacker's knowledge, two of which\n",
    "are: **white-box** and **black-box**. A *white-box* attack assumes the\n",
    "attacker has full knowledge and access to the model, including\n",
    "architecture, inputs, outputs, and weights. A *black-box* attack assumes\n",
    "the attacker only has access to the inputs and outputs of the model, and\n",

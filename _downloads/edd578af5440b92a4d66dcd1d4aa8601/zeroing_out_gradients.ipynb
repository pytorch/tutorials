    "Zeroing out gradients in PyTorch\n",
    "================================\n",
    "\n",
    "It is beneficial to zero out gradients when building a neural network.\n",
    "This is because by default, gradients are accumulated in buffers (i.e,\n",
    "not overwritten) whenever `.backward()` is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "When training your neural network, models are able to increase their\n",
    "accuracy through gradient descent. In short, gradient descent is the\n",
    "process of minimizing our loss (or error) by tweaking the weights and\n",
    "biases in our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "`torch.Tensor` is the central class of PyTorch. When you create a\n",
    "tensor, if you set its attribute `.requires_grad` as `True`, the package\n",
    "tracks all operations on it. This happens on subsequent backward passes.\n",
    "The gradient for this tensor will be accumulated into `.grad` attribute.\n",
    "The accumulation (or sum) of all the gradients is calculated when\n",
    ".backward() is called on the loss tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are cases where it may be necessary to zero-out the gradients of a\n",
    "tensor. For example: when you start your training loop, you should zero\n",
    "out the gradients so that you can perform this tracking correctly. In\n",
    "this recipe, we will learn how to zero out gradients using the PyTorch\n",
    "library. We will demonstrate how to do this by training a neural network\n",
    "on the `CIFAR10` dataset built into PyTorch.\n",

    "Setup\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we will be training data in this recipe, if you are in a runnable\n",
    "notebook, it is best to switch the runtime to GPU or TPU. Before we\n",

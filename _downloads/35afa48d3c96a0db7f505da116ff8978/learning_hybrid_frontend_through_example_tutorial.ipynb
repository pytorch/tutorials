    "Learning Hybrid Frontend Syntax Through Example\n",
    "===============================================\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** [Nathan Inkawhich](https://github.com/inkawhich)\n",
    "\n",
    "This document is meant to highlight the syntax of the Hybrid Frontend\n",
    "through a non-code intensive example. The Hybrid Frontend is one of the\n",
    "new shiny features of Pytorch 1.0 and provides an avenue for developers\n",
    "to transition their models from **eager** to **graph** mode. PyTorch\n",
    "users are very familiar with eager mode as it provides the ease-of-use\n",
    "and flexibility that we all enjoy as researchers. Caffe2 users are more\n",
    "aquainted with graph mode which has the benefits of speed, optimization\n",
    "opportunities, and functionality in C++ runtime environments. The hybrid\n",
    "frontend bridges the gap between the the two modes by allowing\n",
    "researchers to develop and refine their models in eager mode (i.e.\n",
    "PyTorch), then gradually transition the proven model to graph mode for\n",
    "production, when speed and resouce consumption become critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid Frontend Information\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The process for transitioning a model to graph mode is as follows.\n",
    "First, the developer constructs, trains, and tests the model in eager\n",
    "mode. Then they incrementally **trace** and **script** each\n",
    "function/module of the model with the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, at\n",
    "each step verifying that the output is correct. Finally, when each of\n",
    "the components of the top-level model have been traced and scripted, the\n",
    "model itself is traced. At which point the model has been transitioned\n",
    "to graph mode, and has a complete python-free representation. With this\n",
    "representation, the model runtime can take advantage of high-performance\n",
    "Caffe2 operators and graph based optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we continue, it is important to understand the idea of tracing\n",
    "and scripting, and why they are separate. The goal of **trace** and\n",
    "**script** is the same, and that is to create a graph representation of\n",
    "the operations taking place in a given function. The discrepency comes\n",
    "from the flexibility of eager mode that allows for **data-dependent\n",
    "control flows** within the model architecture. When a function does NOT\n",
    "have a data-dependent control flow, it may be *traced* with\n",
    "`torch.jit.trace`. However, when the function *has* a data-dependent\n",
    "control flow it must be *scripted* with `torch.jit.script`. We will\n",
    "leave the details of the interworkings of the hybrid frontend for\n",
    "another document, but the code example below will show the syntax of how\n",
    "to trace and script different pure python functions and torch Modules.\n",
    "Hopefully, you will find that using the hybrid frontend is non-intrusive\n",
    "as it mostly involves adding decorators to the existing function and\n",
    "class definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivating Example\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will implement a strange math function that may be\n",
    "logically broken up into four parts that do, and do not contain\n",
    "data-dependent control flows. The purpose here is to show a non-code\n",
    "intensive example where the use of the JIT is highlighted. This example\n",
    "is a stand-in representation of a useful model, whose implementation has\n",
    "been divided into various pure python functions and modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function we seek to implement, $Y(x)$, is defined for\n",
    "$x \\epsilon \\mathbb{N}$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z(x) = \\Biggl \\lfloor \\frac{\\sqrt{\\prod_{i=1}^{|2 x|}i}}{5} \\Biggr \\rfloor$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "Y(x) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "  \\frac{z(x)}{2}  &  \\text{if } z(x)\\%2 == 0, \\\\\n",
    "  z(x)             &  \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\begin{array}{| r  | r |} \\hline\n",
    "x &1 &2 &3 &4 &5 &6 &7 \\\\ \\hline\n",
    "Y(x) &0 &0 &-5 &20 &190 &-4377 &-59051 \\\\ \\hline\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, the computation is split into four parts. Part one is the\n",
    "simple tensor calculation of $|2x|$, which can be traced. Part two is\n",
    "the iterative product calculation that represents a data dependent\n",
    "control flow to be scripted (the number of loop iteration depends on the\n",
    "input at runtime). Part three is a trace-able\n",
    "$\\lfloor \\sqrt{a/5} \\rfloor$ calculation. Finally, part 4 handles the\n",
    "output cases depending on the value of $z(x)$ and must be scripted due\n",
    "to the data dependency. Now, let\\'s see how this looks in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1 - Tracing a pure python function\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement part one as a pure python function as below. Notice, to\n",
    "trace this function we call `torch.jit.trace` and pass in the function\n",

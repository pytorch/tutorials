        "\n# Learning Hybrid Frontend Syntax Through Example\n**Author:** [Nathan Inkawhich](https://github.com/inkawhich)\n\nThis document is meant to highlight the syntax of the Hybrid Frontend\nthrough a non-code intensive example. The Hybrid Frontend is one of the\nnew shiny features of Pytorch 1.0 and provides an avenue for developers\nto transition their models from **eager** to **graph** mode. PyTorch\nusers are very familiar with eager mode as it provides the ease-of-use\nand flexibility that we all enjoy as researchers. Caffe2 users are more\naquainted with graph mode which has the benefits of speed, optimization\nopportunities, and functionality in C++ runtime environments. The hybrid\nfrontend bridges the gap between the the two modes by allowing\nresearchers to develop and refine their models in eager mode (i.e.\nPyTorch), then gradually transition the proven model to graph mode for\nproduction, when speed and resouce consumption become critical.\n\n## Hybrid Frontend Information\n\nThe process for transitioning a model to graph mode is as follows.\nFirst, the developer constructs, trains, and tests the model in eager\nmode. Then they incrementally **trace** and **script** each\nfunction/module of the model with the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, at\neach step verifying that the output is correct. Finally, when each of\nthe components of the top-level model have been traced and scripted, the\nmodel itself is traced. At which point the model has been transitioned\nto graph mode, and has a complete python-free representation. With this\nrepresentation, the model runtime can take advantage of high-performance\nCaffe2 operators and graph based optimizations.\n\nBefore we continue, it is important to understand the idea of tracing\nand scripting, and why they are separate. The goal of **trace** and\n**script** is the same, and that is to create a graph representation of\nthe operations taking place in a given function. The discrepency comes\nfrom the flexibility of eager mode that allows for **data-dependent\ncontrol flows** within the model architecture. When a function does NOT\nhave a data-dependent control flow, it may be *traced* with\n``torch.jit.trace``. However, when the function *has* a data-dependent\ncontrol flow it must be *scripted* with ``torch.jit.script``. We will\nleave the details of the interworkings of the hybrid frontend for\nanother document, but the code example below will show the syntax of how\nto trace and script different pure python functions and torch Modules.\nHopefully, you will find that using the hybrid frontend is non-intrusive\nas it mostly involves adding decorators to the existing function and\nclass definitions.\n\n## Motivating Example\n\nIn this example we will implement a strange math function that may be\nlogically broken up into four parts that do, and do not contain\ndata-dependent control flows. The purpose here is to show a non-code\nintensive example where the use of the JIT is highlighted. This example\nis a stand-in representation of a useful model, whose implementation has\nbeen divided into various pure python functions and modules.\n\nThe function we seek to implement, $Y(x)$, is defined for\n$x \\epsilon \\mathbb{N}$ as\n\n\\begin{align}z(x) = \\Biggl \\lfloor \\frac{\\sqrt{\\prod_{i=1}^{|2 x|}i}}{5} \\Biggr \\rfloor\\end{align}\n\n\\begin{align}Y(x) = \\begin{cases}\n      \\frac{z(x)}{2}  &  \\text{if } z(x)\\%2 == 0, \\\\\n      z(x)             &  \\text{otherwise}\n    \\end{cases}\\end{align}\n\n\\begin{align}\\begin{array}{| r  | r |} \\hline\n    x &1 &2 &3 &4 &5 &6 &7 \\\\ \\hline\n    Y(x) &0 &0 &-5 &20 &190 &-4377 &-59051 \\\\ \\hline\n    \\end{array}\\end{align}\n\nAs mentioned, the computation is split into four parts. Part one is the\nsimple tensor calculation of $|2x|$, which can be traced. Part two\nis the iterative product calculation that represents a data dependent\ncontrol flow to be scripted (the number of loop iteration depends on the\ninput at runtime). Part three is a trace-able\n$\\lfloor \\sqrt{a/5} \\rfloor$ calculation. Finally, part 4 handles\nthe output cases depending on the value of $z(x)$ and must be\nscripted due to the data dependency. Now, let's see how this looks in\ncode.\n\n### Part 1 - Tracing a pure python function\n\nWe can implement part one as a pure python function as below. Notice, to\ntrace this function we call ``torch.jit.trace`` and pass in the function\nto be traced. Since the trace requires a dummy input of the expected\nruntime type and shape, we also include the ``torch.rand`` to generate a\nsingle valued torch tensor.\n"

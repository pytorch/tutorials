        "Overview\n --------\n\n This tutorial demonstrates how to use a pretrained T5 Model for summarization, sentiment classification, and\n translation tasks. We will demonstrate how to use the torchtext library to:\n\n 1. Build a text preprocessing pipeline for a T5 model\n 2. Instantiate a pretrained T5 model with base configuration\n 3. Read in the CNNDM, IMDB, and Multi30k datasets and preprocess their texts in preparation for the model\n 4. Perform text summarization, sentiment classification, and translation\n\n .. note::\n    This tutorial requires PyTorch 2.0.0 or later.\n\n######################################################################\n Data Transformation\n -------------------\n\n The T5 model does not work with raw text. Instead, it requires the text to be transformed into numerical form\n in order to perform training and inference. The following transformations are required for the T5 model:\n\n 1. Tokenize text\n 2. Convert tokens into (integer) IDs\n 3. Truncate the sequences to a specified maximum length\n 4. Add end-of-sequence (EOS) and padding token IDs\n\n T5 uses a ``SentencePiece`` model for text tokenization. Below, we use a pretrained ``SentencePiece`` model to build\n the text preprocessing pipeline using torchtext's T5Transform. Note that the transform supports both\n batched and non-batched text input (for example, one can either pass a single sentence or a list of sentences), however the T5 model expects the input to be batched.\n\n\n"

        "## Sentiment Output\n\n::\n\n   Example 1:\n\n   input_text: sst2 sentence: I love sci-fi and am willing to put up with a lot. Sci-fi\n   movies/TV are usually underfunded, under-appreciated and misunderstood. I tried to like\n   this, I really did, but it is to good TV sci-fi as Babylon 5 is to Star Trek (the original).\n   Silly prosthetics, cheap cardboard sets, stilted dialogues, CG that doesn't match the\n   background, and painfully one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a 'sci-fi'\n   setting. (I'm sure there are those of you out there who think Babylon 5 is good sci-fi TV.\n   It's not. It's clich\u00e9d and uninspiring.) While US viewers might like emotion and character\n   development, sci-fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously (cf. Star Trek). It may\n   treat important issues, yet not as a serious philosophy. It's really difficult to care about\n   the characters here as they are not simply foolish, just missing a spark of life. Their\n   actions and reactions are wooden and predictable, often painful to watch. The makers of Earth\n   KNOW it's rubbish as they have to always say \"Gene Roddenberry's Earth...\" otherwise people\n   would not continue watching. Roddenberry's ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull,\n   cheap, poorly edited (watching it without advert breaks really brings this home) trudging\n   Trabant of a show lumbers into space. Spoiler. So, kill off a main character. And then bring\n   him back as another actor. Jeeez. Dallas all over again.\n\n   prediction: negative\n\n   target: negative\n\n\n   Example 2:\n\n   input_text: sst2 sentence: Worth the entertainment value of a rental, especially if you like\n   action movies. This one features the usual car chases, fights with the great Van Damme kick\n   style, shooting battles with the 40 shell load shotgun, and even terrorist style bombs. All\n   of this is entertaining and competently handled but there is nothing that really blows you\n   away if you've seen your share before.<br /><br />The plot is made interesting by the\n   inclusion of a rabbit, which is clever but hardly profound. Many of the characters are\n   heavily stereotyped -- the angry veterans, the terrified illegal aliens, the crooked cops,\n   the indifferent feds, the bitchy tough lady station head, the crooked politician, the fat\n   federale who looks like he was typecast as the Mexican in a Hollywood movie from the 1940s.\n   All passably acted but again nothing special.<br /><br />I thought the main villains were\n   pretty well done and fairly well acted. By the end of the movie you certainly knew who the\n   good guys were and weren't. There was an emotional lift as the really bad ones got their just\n   deserts. Very simplistic, but then you weren't expecting Hamlet, right? The only thing I found\n   really annoying was the constant cuts to VDs daughter during the last fight scene.<br /><br />\n   Not bad. Not good. Passable 4.\n\n   prediction: positive\n\n   target: negative\n\n\n   Example 3:\n\n   input_text: sst2 sentence: its a totally average film with a few semi-alright action sequences\n   that make the plot seem a little better and remind the viewer of the classic van dam films.\n   parts of the plot don't make sense and seem to be added in to use up time. the end plot is that\n   of a very basic type that doesn't leave the viewer guessing and any twists are obvious from the\n   beginning. the end scene with the flask backs don't make sense as they are added in and seem to\n   have little relevance to the history of van dam's character. not really worth watching again,\n   bit disappointed in the end production, even though it is apparent it was shot on a low budget\n   certain shots and sections in the film are of poor directed quality.\n\n   prediction: negative\n\n   target: negative\n\n\n"

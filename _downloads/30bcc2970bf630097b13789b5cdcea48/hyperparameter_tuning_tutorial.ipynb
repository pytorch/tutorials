    "Tune. Ray Tune can then use these metrics to decide which hyperparameter\n",
    "configuration lead to the best results. These metrics can also be used\n",
    "to stop bad performing trials early in order to avoid wasting resources\n",
    "on those trials.\n",
    "\n",

    "Training](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/examples/pbt_guide.html).\n",
    "Also, by saving the checkpoint we can later load the trained models and\n",

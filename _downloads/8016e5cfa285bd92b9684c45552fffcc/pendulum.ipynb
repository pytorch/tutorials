        "To give a sense of what can be achieved with TorchRL's environments, we will\nbe designing a *stateless* environment. While stateful environments keep track of\nthe latest physical state encountered and rely on this to simulate the state-to-state\ntransition, stateless environments expect the current state to be provided to\nthem at each step, along with the action undertaken. TorchRL supports both\ntypes of environments, but stateless environments are more generic and hence\ncover a broader range of features of the environment API in TorchRL.\n\nModeling stateless environments gives users full control over the input and\noutputs of the simulator: one can reset an experiment at any stage or actively\nmodify the dynamics from the outside. However, it assumes that we have some control\nover a task, which may not always be the case: solving a problem where we cannot\ncontrol the current state is more challenging but has a much wider set of applications.\n\nAnother advantage of stateless environments is that they can enable\nbatched execution of transition simulations. If the backend and the\nimplementation allow it, an algebraic operation can be executed seamlessly on\nscalars, vectors, or tensors. This tutorial gives such examples.\n\nThis tutorial will be structured as follows:\n\n* We will first get acquainted with the environment properties:\n  its shape (``batch_size``), its methods (mainly :meth:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase.step`,\n  :meth:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase.reset` and :meth:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase.set_seed`)\n  and finally its specs.\n* After having coded our simulator, we will demonstrate how it can be used\n  during training with transforms.\n* We will explore new avenues that follow from the TorchRL's API,\n  including: the possibility of transforming inputs, the vectorized execution\n  of the simulation and the possibility of backpropagation through the\n  simulation graph.\n* Finally, we will train a simple policy to solve the system we implemented.\n\n\n"

        "There are four things you must take care of when designing a new environment\nclass:\n\n* :meth:`EnvBase._reset`, which codes for the resetting of the simulator\n  at a (potentially random) initial state;\n* :meth:`EnvBase._step` which codes for the state transition dynamic;\n* :meth:`EnvBase._set_seed`` which implements the seeding mechanism;\n* the environment specs.\n\nLet us first describe the problem at hand: we would like to model a simple\npendulum over which we can control the torque applied on its fixed point.\nOur goal is to place the pendulum in upward position (angular position at 0\nby convention) and having it standing still in that position.\nTo design our dynamic system, we need to define two equations: the motion\nequation following an action (the torque applied) and the reward equation\nthat will constitute our objective function.\n\nFor the motion equation, we will update the angular velocity following:\n\n\\begin{align}\\dot{\\theta}_{t+1} = \\dot{\\theta}_t + (3 * g / (2 * L) * \\sin(\\theta_t) + 3 / (m * L^2) * u) * dt\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\dot{\\theta}$ is the angular velocity in rad/sec, $g$ is the\ngravitational force, $L$ is the pendulum length, $m$ is its mass,\n$\\theta$ is its angular position and $u$ is the torque. The\nangular position is then updated according to\n\n\\begin{align}\\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_{t} + \\dot{\\theta}_{t+1} dt\\end{align}\n\nWe define our reward as\n\n\\begin{align}r = -(\\theta^2 + 0.1 * \\dot{\\theta}^2 + 0.001 * u^2)\\end{align}\n\nwhich will be maximized when the angle is close to 0 (pendulum in upward\nposition), the angular velocity is close to 0 (no motion) and the torque is\n0 too.\n\n## Coding the effect of an action: :func:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase._step`\n\nThe step method is the first thing to consider, as it will encode\nthe simulation that is of interest to us. In TorchRL, the\n:class:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase` class has a :meth:`EnvBase.step`\nmethod that receives a :class:`tensordict.TensorDict`\ninstance with an ``\"action\"`` entry indicating what action is to be taken.\n\nTo facilitate the reading and writing from that ``tensordict`` and to make sure\nthat the keys are consistent with what's expected from the library, the\nsimulation part has been delegated to a private abstract method :meth:`_step`\nwhich reads input data from a ``tensordict``, and writes a *new*  ``tensordict``\nwith the output data.\n\nThe :func:`_step` method should do the following:\n\n  1. Read the input keys (such as ``\"action\"``) and execute the simulation\n     based on these;\n  2. Retrieve observations, done state and reward;\n  3. Write the set of observation values along with the reward and done state\n     at the corresponding entries in a new :class:`TensorDict`.\n\nNext, the :meth:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase.step` method will merge the output\nof :meth:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase.step` in the input ``tensordict`` to enforce\ninput/output consistency.\n\nTypically, for stateful environments, this will look like this:\n\n```\n>>> policy(env.reset())\n>>> print(tensordict)\nTensorDict(\n    fields={\n        action: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([1]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.float32, is_shared=False),\n        done: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([1]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.bool, is_shared=False),\n        observation: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.float32, is_shared=False)},\n    batch_size=torch.Size([]),\n    device=cpu,\n    is_shared=False)\n>>> env.step(tensordict)\n>>> print(tensordict)\nTensorDict(\n    fields={\n        action: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([1]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.float32, is_shared=False),\n        done: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([1]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.bool, is_shared=False),\n        next: TensorDict(\n            fields={\n                done: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([1]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.bool, is_shared=False),\n                observation: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.float32, is_shared=False),\n                reward: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([1]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.float32, is_shared=False)},\n            batch_size=torch.Size([]),\n            device=cpu,\n            is_shared=False),\n        observation: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.float32, is_shared=False)},\n    batch_size=torch.Size([]),\n    device=cpu,\n    is_shared=False)\n```\nNotice that the root ``tensordict`` has not changed, the only modification is the\nappearance of a new ``\"next\"`` entry that contains the new information.\n\nIn the Pendulum example, our :meth:`_step` method will read the relevant\nentries from the input ``tensordict`` and compute the position and velocity of\nthe pendulum after the force encoded by the ``\"action\"`` key has been applied\nonto it. We compute the new angular position of the pendulum\n``\"new_th\"`` as the result of the previous position ``\"th\"`` plus the new\nvelocity ``\"new_thdot\"`` over a time interval ``dt``.\n\nSince our goal is to turn the pendulum up and maintain it still in that\nposition, our ``cost`` (negative reward) function is lower for positions\nclose to the target and low speeds.\nIndeed, we want to discourage positions that are far from being \"upward\"\nand/or speeds that are far from 0.\n\nIn our example, :meth:`EnvBase._step` is encoded as a static method since our\nenvironment is stateless. In stateful settings, the ``self`` argument is\nneeded as the state needs to be read from the environment.\n\n\n"

        "## Environment metadata: ``env.*_spec``\n\nThe specs define the input and output domain of the environment.\nIt is important that the specs accurately define the tensors that will be\nreceived at runtime, as they are often used to carry information about\nenvironments in multiprocessing and distributed settings. They can also be\nused to instantiate lazily defined neural networks and test scripts without\nactually querying the environment (which can be costly with real-world\nphysical systems for instance).\n\nThere are four specs that we must code in our environment:\n\n* :obj:`EnvBase.observation_spec`: This will be a :class:`~torchrl.data.CompositeSpec`\n  instance where each key is an observation (a :class:`CompositeSpec` can be\n  viewed as a dictionary of specs).\n* :obj:`EnvBase.action_spec`: It can be any type of spec, but it is required\n  that it corresponds to the ``\"action\"`` entry in the input ``tensordict``;\n* :obj:`EnvBase.reward_spec`: provides information about the reward space;\n* :obj:`EnvBase.done_spec`: provides information about the space of the done\n  flag.\n\nTorchRL specs are organized in two general containers: ``input_spec`` which\ncontains the specs of the information that the step function reads (divided\nbetween ``action_spec`` containing the action and ``state_spec`` containing\nall the rest), and ``output_spec`` which encodes the specs that the\nstep outputs (``observation_spec``, ``reward_spec`` and ``done_spec``).\nIn general, you should not interact directly with ``output_spec`` and\n``input_spec`` but only with their content: ``observation_spec``,\n``reward_spec``, ``done_spec``, ``action_spec`` and ``state_spec``.\nThe reason if that the specs are organized in a non-trivial way\nwithin ``output_spec`` and\n``input_spec`` and neither of these should be directly modified.\n\nIn other words, the ``observation_spec`` and related properties are\nconvenient shortcuts to the content of the output and input spec containers.\n\nTorchRL offers multiple :class:`~torchrl.data.TensorSpec`\n[subclasses](https://pytorch.org/rl/reference/data.html#tensorspec) to\nencode the environment's input and output characteristics.\n\n### Specs shape\n\nThe environment specs leading dimensions must match the\nenvironment batch-size.

        "### Writing custom transforms\n\nTorchRL's transforms may not cover all the operations one wants to execute\nafter an environment has been executed.\nWriting a transform does not require much effort. As for the environment\ndesign, there are two steps in writing a transform:\n\n- Getting the dynamics right (forward and inverse);\n- Adapting the environment specs.\n\nA transform can be used in two settings: on its own, it can be used as a\n:class:`~torch.nn.Module`. It can also be used appended to a\n:class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.TransformedEnv`. The structure of the class allows to\ncustomize the behavior in the different contexts.\n\nA :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.Transform` skeleton can be summarized as follows:\n\n```\nclass Transform(nn.Module):\n    def forward(self, tensordict):\n        ...\n    def _apply_transform(self, tensordict):\n        ...\n    def _step(self, tensordict):\n        ...\n    def _call(self, tensordict):\n        ...\n    def inv(self, tensordict):\n        ...\n    def _inv_apply_transform(self, tensordict):\n        ...\n```\nThere are three entry points (:func:`forward`, :func:`_step` and :func:`inv`)\nwhich all receive :class:`tensordict.TensorDict` instances. The first two\nwill eventually go through the keys indicated by :obj:`~tochrl.envs.transforms.Transform.in_keys`\nand call :meth:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.Transform._apply_transform` to each of these. The results will\nbe written in the entries pointed by :obj:`Transform.out_keys` if provided\n(if not the ``in_keys`` will be updated with the transformed values).\nIf inverse transforms need to be executed, a similar data flow will be\nexecuted but with the :func:`Transform.inv` and\n:func:`Transform._inv_apply_transform` methods and across the ``in_keys_inv``\nand ``out_keys_inv`` list of keys.\nThe following figure summarized this flow for environments and replay\nbuffers.\n\n\n   Transform API\n\nIn some cases, a transform will not work on a subset of keys in a unitary\nmanner, but will execute some operation on the parent environment or\nwork with the entire input ``tensordict``.\nIn those cases, the :func:`_call` and :func:`forward` methods should be\nre-written, and the :func:`_apply_transform` method can be skipped.\n\nLet us code new transforms that will compute the ``sine`` and ``cosine``\nvalues of the position angle, as these values are more useful to us to learn\na policy than the raw angle value:\n\n"

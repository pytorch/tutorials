A computation graph is simply a\nspecification of how your data is combined to give you the output. Since\nthe graph totally specifies what parameters were involved with which\noperations, it contains enough information to compute derivatives. This\nprobably sounds vague, so let's see what is going on using the\nfundamental flag ``requires_grad``.\n\nFirst, think from a programmers perspective. What is stored in the\ntorch.Tensor objects we were creating above? Obviously the data and the\nshape, and maybe a few other things. But when we added two tensors\ntogether, we got an output tensor. All this output tensor knows is its\ndata and shape. It has no idea that it was the sum of two other tensors\n(it could have been read in from a file, it could be the result of some\nother operation, etc.)\n\nIf ``requires_grad=True``, the Tensor object keeps track of how it was\ncreated.

        "### 2. Use profiler to record execution events\n\nThe profiler is enabled through the context manager and accepts several parameters,\nsome of the most useful are:\n\n- ``schedule`` - callable that takes step (int) as a single parameter\n  and returns the profiler action to perform at each step.\n\n  In this example with ``wait=1, warmup=1, active=3, repeat=2``,\n  profiler will skip the first step/iteration,\n  start warming up on the second,\n  record the following three iterations,\n  after which the trace will become available and on_trace_ready (when set) is called.\n  In total, the cycle repeats twice. Each cycle is called a \"span\" in TensorBoard plugin.\n\n  During ``wait`` steps, the profiler is disabled.\n  During ``warmup`` steps, the profiler starts tracing but the results are discarded.\n  This is for reducing the profiling overhead.\n  The overhead at the beginning of profiling is high and easy to bring skew to the profiling result.\n  During ``active`` steps, the profiler works and records events.\n- ``on_trace_ready`` - callable that is called at the end of each cycle;\n  In this example we use ``torch.profiler.tensorboard_trace_handler`` to generate result files for TensorBoard.\n  After profiling, result files will be saved into the ``./log/resnet18`` directory.\n  Specify this directory as a ``logdir`` parameter to analyze profile in TensorBoard.\n- ``record_shapes`` - whether to record shapes of the operator inputs.\n- ``profile_memory`` - Track tensor memory allocation/deallocation. Note, for old version of pytorch with version\n  before 1.10, if you suffer long profiling time, please disable it or upgrade to new version.\n- ``with_stack`` - Record source information (file and line number) for the ops.\n  If the TensorBoard is launched in VS Code ([reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/pytorch-support#_tensorboard-integration)),\n  clicking a stack frame will navigate to the specific code line.\n\n"

        "### 6. Analyze performance with other advanced features\n\n- Memory view\nTo profile memory, ``profile_memory`` must be set to ``True`` in arguments of ``torch.profiler.profile``.\n\nYou can try it by using existing example on Azure\n\n```\npip install azure-storage-blob\ntensorboard --logdir=https://torchtbprofiler.blob.core.windows.net/torchtbprofiler/demo/memory_demo_1_10\n```\nThe profiler records all memory allocation/release events and allocator's internal state during profiling.\nThe memory view consists of three components as shown in the following.\n\n<img src=\"file://../../_static/img/profiler_memory_view.png\" scale=\"25 %\">\n\nThe components are memory curve graph, memory events table and memory statistics table, from top to bottom, respectively.\n\nThe memory type could be selected in \"Device\" selection box.\nFor example, \"GPU0\" means the following table only shows each operator's memory usage on GPU 0, not including CPU or other GPUs.\n\nThe memory curve shows the trends of memory consumption. The \"Allocated\" curve shows the total memory that is actually\nin use, e.g., tensors. In PyTorch, caching mechanism is employed in CUDA allocator and some other allocators. The\n\"Reserved\" curve shows the total memory that is reserved by the allocator. You can left click and drag on the graph\nto select events in the desired range:\n\n<img src=\"file://../../_static/img/profiler_memory_curve_selecting.png\" scale=\"25 %\">\n\nAfter selection, the three components will be updated for the restricted time range, so that you can gain more\ninformation about it. By repeating this process, you can zoom into a very fine-grained detail. Right click on the graph\nwill reset the graph to the initial state.\n\n<img src=\"file://../../_static/img/profiler_memory_curve_single.png\" scale=\"25 %\">\n\nIn the memory events table, the allocation and release events are paired into one entry. The \"operator\" column shows\nthe immediate ATen operator that is causing the allocation. Notice that in PyTorch, ATen operators commonly use\n``aten::empty`` to allocate memory. For example, ``aten::ones`` is implemented as ``aten::empty`` followed by an\n``aten::fill_``. Solely display the operator name as ``aten::empty`` is of little help. It will be shown as\n``aten::ones (aten::empty)`` in this special case. The \"Allocation Time\", \"Release Time\" and \"Duration\"\ncolumns' data might be missing if the event occurs outside of the time range. \n\nIn the memory statistics table, the \"Size Increase\" column sums up all allocation size and minus all the memory\nrelease size, that is, the net increase of memory usage after this operator. The \"Self Size Increase\" column is\nsimilar to \"Size Increase\", but it does not count children operators' allocation. With regards to ATen operators'\nimplementation detail, some operators might call other operators, so memory allocations can happen at any level of the\ncall stack. That says, \"Self Size Increase\" only count the memory usage increase at current level of call stack.\nFinally, the \"Allocation Size\" column sums up all allocation without considering the memory release.\n\n- Distributed view\nThe plugin now supports distributed view on profiling DDP with NCCL/GLOO as backend.\n\nYou can try it by using existing example on Azure:\n\n```\npip install azure-storage-blob\ntensorboard --logdir=https://torchtbprofiler.blob.core.windows.net/torchtbprofiler/demo/distributed_bert\n```\n<img src=\"file://../../_static/img/profiler_distributed_view.png\" scale=\"25 %\">\n\nThe \"Computation/Communication Overview\" shows computation/communication ratio and their overlapping degree.\nFrom this view, User can figure out load balance issue among workers.\nFor example, if the computation + overlapping time of one worker is much larger than others,\nthere may be a problem of load balance or this worker may be a straggler.\n\nThe \"Synchronizing/Communication Overview\" shows the efficiency of communication.\n\"Data Transfer Time\" is the time for actual data exchanging.\n\"Synchronizing Time\" is the time for waiting and synchronizing with other workers.\n\nIf one worker\u2019s \"Synchronizing Time\" is much shorter than that of other workers\u2019,\nthis worker may be a straggler which may have more computation workload than other workers\u2019.\n\nThe \"Communication Operations Stats\" summarizes the detailed statistics of all communication ops in each worker.\n\n"

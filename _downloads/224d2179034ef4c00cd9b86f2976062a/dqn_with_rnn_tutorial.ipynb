        "## Overview\n\nMemory-based policies are crucial not only when the observations are partially\nobservable but also when the time dimension must be taken into account to\nmake informed decisions.\n\nRecurrent neural network have long been a popular tool for memory-based\npolicies. The idea is to keep a recurrent state in memory between two\nconsecutive steps, and use this as an input to the policy along with the\ncurrent observation.\n\nThis tutorial shows how to incorporate an RNN in a policy using TorchRL.\n\nKey learnings:\n\n- Incorporating an RNN in an actor in TorchRL;\n- Using that memory-based policy with a replay buffer and a loss module.\n\nThe core idea of using RNNs in TorchRL is to use TensorDict as a data carrier\nfor the hidden states from one step to another. We'll build a policy that\nreads the previous recurrent state from the current TensorDict, and writes the\ncurrent recurrent states in the TensorDict of the next state:\n\n.. figure:: /_static/img/rollout_recurrent.png\n   :alt: Data collection with a recurrent policy\n\nAs this figure shows, our environment populates the TensorDict with zeroed recurrent\nstates which are read by the policy together with the observation to produce an\naction, and recurrent states that will be used for the next step.\nWhen the :func:`~torchrl.envs.utils.step_mdp` function is called, the recurrent states\nfrom the next state are brought to the current TensorDict. Let's see how this\nis implemented in practice.\n\n"

        "## Environment\n\nAs usual, the first step is to build our environment: it helps us\ndefine the problem and build the policy network accordingly. For this tutorial,\nwe'll be running a single pixel-based instance of the CartPole gym\nenvironment with some custom transforms: turning to grayscale, resizing to\n84x84, scaling down the rewards and normalizing the observations.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>The :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.StepCounter` transform is accessory. Since the CartPole\n  task goal is to make trajectories as long as possible, counting the steps\n  can help us track the performance of our policy.</p></div>\n\nTwo transforms are important for the purpose of this tutorial:\n\n- :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.InitTracker` will stamp the\n  calls to :meth:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase.reset` by adding a ``\"is_init\"``\n  boolean mask in the TensorDict that will track which steps require a reset\n  of the RNN hidden states.\n- The :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.TensorDictPrimer` transform is a bit more\n  technical. It is not required to use RNN policies. However, it\n  instructs the environment (and subsequently the collector) that some extra\n  keys are to be expected. Once added, a call to `env.reset()` will populate\n  the entries indicated in the primer with zeroed tensors. Knowing that\n  these tensors are expected by the policy, the collector will pass them on\n  during collection. Eventually, we'll be storing our hidden states in the\n  replay buffer, which will help us bootstrap the computation of the\n  RNN operations in the loss module (which would otherwise be initiated\n  with 0s). In summary: not including this transform will not impact hugely\n  the training of our policy, but it will make the recurrent keys disappear\n  from the collected data and the replay buffer, which will in turn lead to\n  a slightly less optimal training.\n  Fortunately, the :class:`~torchrl.modules.LSTMModule` we propose is\n  equipped with a helper method to build just that transform for us, so\n  we can wait until we build it!\n\n\n"

        "## Conclusion\n\nWe have seen how an RNN can be incorporated in a policy in TorchRL.\nYou should now be able:\n\n- Create an LSTM module that acts as a :class:`~tensordict.nn.TensorDictModule`\n- Indicate to the LSTM module that a reset is needed via an :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.InitTracker`\n  transform\n- Incorporate this module in a policy and in a loss module\n- Make sure that the collector is made aware of the recurrent state entries\n  such that they can be stored in the replay buffer along with the rest of\n  the data\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- The TorchRL documentation can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/rl/).\n\n"

    "like all of the other weights of the model via gradient descent!\n",

    "as lookup indices to respective embedding tables!\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are trained in RecSys through the following process:\n",

    "    consistent shapes.\n",
    "-   The **embeddings are used in conjunction with the rest of the model\n",

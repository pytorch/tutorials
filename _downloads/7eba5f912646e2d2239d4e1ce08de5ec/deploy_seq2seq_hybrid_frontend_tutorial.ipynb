    "This tutorial will walk through the process of transitioning a\n",
    "sequence-to-sequence model to TorchScript using the TorchScript API. The\n",
    "model that we will convert is the chatbot model from the [Chatbot\n",
    "tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/chatbot_tutorial.html).\n",
    "You can either treat this tutorial as a \"Part 2\" to the Chatbot tutorial\n",
    "and deploy your own pretrained model, or you can start with this\n",
    "document and use a pretrained model that we host. In the latter case,\n",
    "you can reference the original Chatbot tutorial for details regarding\n",
    "data preprocessing, model theory and definition, and model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is TorchScript?\n",
    "====================\n",
    "\n",
    "During the research and development phase of a deep learning-based\n",
    "project, it is advantageous to interact with an **eager**, imperative\n",
    "interface like PyTorch's. This gives users the ability to write\n",
    "familiar, idiomatic Python, allowing for the use of Python data\n",
    "structures, control flow operations, print statements, and debugging\n",
    "utilities. Although the eager interface is a beneficial tool for\n",
    "research and experimentation applications, when it comes time to deploy\n",
    "the model in a production environment, having a **graph**-based model\n",
    "representation is very beneficial. A deferred graph representation\n",
    "allows for optimizations such as out-of-order execution, and the ability\n",
    "to target highly optimized hardware architectures. Also, a graph-based\n",
    "representation enables framework-agnostic model exportation. PyTorch\n",
    "provides mechanisms for incrementally converting eager-mode code into\n",
    "TorchScript, a statically analyzable and optimizable subset of Python\n",
    "that Torch uses to represent deep learning programs independently from\n",
    "the Python runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API for converting eager-mode PyTorch programs into TorchScript is\n",
    "found in the `torch.jit` module. This module has two core modalities for\n",
    "converting an eager-mode model to a TorchScript graph representation:\n",
    "**tracing** and **scripting**. The `torch.jit.trace` function takes a\n",
    "module or function and a set of example inputs. It then runs the example\n",
    "input through the function or module while tracing the computational\n",
    "steps that are encountered, and outputs a graph-based function that\n",
    "performs the traced operations. **Tracing** is great for straightforward\n",
    "modules and functions that do not involve data-dependent control flow,\n",
    "such as standard convolutional neural networks. However, if a function\n",
    "with data-dependent if statements and loops is traced, only the\n",
    "operations called along the execution route taken by the example input\n",
    "will be recorded. In other words, the control flow itself is not\n",
    "captured. To convert modules and functions containing data-dependent\n",
    "control flow, a **scripting** mechanism is provided. The\n",
    "`torch.jit.script` function/decorator takes a module or function and\n",
    "does not requires example inputs. Scripting then explicitly converts the\n",
    "module or function code to TorchScript, including all control flows. One\n",
    "caveat with using scripting is that it only supports a subset of Python,\n",
    "so you might need to rewrite the code to make it compatible with the\n",
    "TorchScript syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all details relating to the supported features, see the [TorchScript\n",
    "language reference](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/jit.html). To\n",
    "provide the maximum flexibility, you can also mix tracing and scripting\n",
    "modes together to represent your whole program, and these techniques can\n",
    "be applied incrementally.\n",

    "Greedy Search Decoder\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the chatbot tutorial, we use a `GreedySearchDecoder` module to\n",
    "facilitate the actual decoding process. This module has the trained\n",
    "encoder and decoder models as attributes, and drives the process of\n",
    "encoding an input sentence (a vector of word indexes), and iteratively\n",
    "decoding an output response sequence one word (word index) at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding the input sequence is straightforward: simply forward the\n",
    "entire sequence tensor and its corresponding lengths vector to the\n",
    "`encoder`. It is important to note that this module only deals with one\n",
    "input sequence at a time, **NOT** batches of sequences. Therefore, when\n",
    "the constant **1** is used for declaring tensor sizes, this corresponds\n",
    "to a batch size of 1. To decode a given decoder output, we must\n",
    "iteratively run forward passes through our decoder model, which outputs\n",
    "softmax scores corresponding to the probability of each word being the\n",
    "correct next word in the decoded sequence. We initialize the\n",
    "`decoder_input` to a tensor containing an *SOS\\_token*. After each pass\n",
    "through the `decoder`, we *greedily* append the word with the highest\n",
    "softmax probability to the `decoded_words` list. We also use this word\n",
    "as the `decoder_input` for the next iteration. The decoding process\n",
    "terminates either if the `decoded_words` list has reached a length of\n",
    "*MAX\\_LENGTH* or if the predicted word is the *EOS\\_token*.\n",
    "\n",
    "TorchScript Notes:\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The `forward` method of this module involves iterating over the range of\n",
    "$[0, max\\_length)$ when decoding an output sequence one word at a time.\n",
    "Because of this, we should use **scripting** to convert this module to\n",
    "TorchScript. Unlike with our encoder and decoder models, which we can\n",
    "trace, we must make some necessary changes to the `GreedySearchDecoder`\n",
    "module in order to initialize an object without error. In other words,\n",
    "we must ensure that our module adheres to the rules of the TorchScript\n",
    "mechanism, and does not utilize any language features outside of the\n",
    "subset of Python that TorchScript includes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an idea of some manipulations that may be required, we will go\n",

    "\n",
    "### Changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Added `decoder_n_layers` to the constructor arguments\n",
    "    -   This change stems from the fact that the encoder and decoder\n",
    "        models that we pass to this module will be a child of\n",
    "        `TracedModule` (not `Module`). Therefore, we cannot access the\n",
    "        decoder's number of layers with `decoder.n_layers`. Instead, we\n",
    "        plan for this, and pass this value in during module\n",
    "        construction.\n",
    "-   Store away new attributes as constants\n",
    "    -   In the original implementation, we were free to use variables\n",
    "        from the surrounding (global) scope in our\n",
    "        `GreedySearchDecoder`'s `forward` method. However, now that we\n",
    "        are using scripting, we do not have this freedom, as the\n",
    "        assumption with scripting is that we cannot necessarily hold on\n",
    "        to Python objects, especially when exporting. An easy solution\n",
    "        to this is to store these values from the global scope as\n",
    "        attributes to the module in the constructor, and add them to a\n",
    "        special list called `__constants__` so that they can be used as\n",
    "        literal values when constructing the graph in the `forward`\n",
    "        method. An example of this usage is on NEW line 19, where\n",
    "        instead of using the `device` and `SOS_token` global values, we\n",
    "        use our constant attributes `self._device` and\n",
    "        `self._SOS_token`.\n",
    "-   Enforce types of `forward` method arguments\n",
    "    -   By default, all parameters to a TorchScript function are assumed\n",
    "        to be Tensor. If we need to pass an argument of a different\n",
    "        type, we can use function type annotations as introduced in [PEP\n",
    "        3107](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/). In addition,\n",
    "        it is possible to declare arguments of different types using\n",
    "        Mypy-style type annotations (see\n",
    "        [doc](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/jit.html#types)).\n",
    "-   Change initialization of `decoder_input`\n",
    "    -   In the original implementation, we initialized our\n",
    "        `decoder_input` tensor with `torch.LongTensor([[SOS_token]])`.\n",
    "        When scripting, we are not allowed to initialize tensors in a\n",
    "        literal fashion like this. Instead, we can initialize our tensor\n",
    "        with an explicit torch function such as `torch.ones`. In this\n",
    "        case, we can easily replicate the scalar `decoder_input` tensor\n",
    "        by multiplying 1 by our SOS\\_token value stored in the constant\n",

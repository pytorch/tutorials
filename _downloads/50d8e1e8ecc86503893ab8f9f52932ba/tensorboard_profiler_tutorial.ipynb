Use profiler to record execution events\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe profiler is enabled through the context manager and accepts several parameters,\nsome of the most useful are:\n\n- ``schedule`` - callable that takes step (int) as a single parameter\n  and returns the profiler action to perform at each step.\n\n  In this example with ``wait=1, warmup=1, active=3, repeat=2``,\n  profiler will skip the first step/iteration,\n  start warming up on the second,\n  record the following three iterations,\n  after which the trace will become available and on_trace_ready (when set) is called.\n  In total, the cycle repeats twice. Each cycle is called a \"span\" in TensorBoard plugin.\n\n  During ``wait`` steps, the profiler is disabled.\n  During ``warmup`` steps, the profiler starts tracing but the results are discarded.\n  This is for reducing the profiling overhead.\n  The overhead at the beginning of profiling is high and easy to bring skew to the profiling result.\n  During ``active`` steps, the profiler works and records events.\n- ``on_trace_ready`` - callable that is called at the end of each cycle;\n  In this example we use ``torch.profiler.tensorboard_trace_handler`` to generate result files for TensorBoard.\n  After profiling, result files will be saved into the ``./log/resnet18`` directory.\n  Specify this directory as a ``logdir`` parameter to analyze profile in TensorBoard.\n- ``record_shapes`` - whether to record shapes of the operator inputs.\n- ``profile_memory`` - Track tensor memory allocation/deallocation.\n- ``with_stack`` - Record source information (file and line number) for the ops.\n  If the TensorBoard is launched in VSCode (`reference <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/pytorch-support#_tensorboard-integration>`_),\n  clicking a stack frame will navigate to the specific code line.\n\n"

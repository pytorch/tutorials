    "Transferring data from the CPU to the GPU is fundamental in many PyTorch\n",
    "applications. It\\'s crucial for users to understand the most effective\n",

    "\n",
    "Optimizing the transfer of tensors from the CPU to the GPU can be\n",
    "achieved through asynchronous transfers and memory pinning. However,\n",
    "there are important considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Using `tensor.pin_memory().to(device, non_blocking=True)` can be up\n",
    "    to twice as slow as a straightforward `tensor.to(device)`.\n",
    "-   Generally, `tensor.to(device, non_blocking=True)` is an effective\n",
    "    choice for enhancing transfer speed.\n",
    "-   While `cpu_tensor.to(\"cuda\", non_blocking=True).mean()` executes\n",
    "    correctly, attempting\n",
    "    `cuda_tensor.to(\"cpu\", non_blocking=True).mean()` will result in\n",
    "    erroneous outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preamble\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance reported in this tutorial are conditioned on the system\n",
    "used to build the tutorial. Although the conclusions are applicable\n",
    "across different systems, the specific observations may vary slightly\n",
    "depending on the hardware available, especially on older hardware. The\n",
    "primary objective of this tutorial is to offer a theoretical framework\n",
    "for understanding CPU to GPU data transfers. However, any design\n",
    "decisions should be tailored to individual cases and guided by\n",
    "benchmarked throughput measurements, as well as the specific\n",
    "requirements of the task at hand.\n"

    "Background\n",
    "==========\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory management basics\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "When one creates a CPU tensor in PyTorch, the content of this tensor\n",
    "needs to be placed in memory. The memory we talk about here is a rather\n",
    "complex concept worth looking at carefully. We distinguish two types of\n",
    "memory that are handled by the Memory Management Unit: the RAM (for\n",
    "simplicity) and the swap space on disk (which may or may not be the hard\n",
    "drive). Together, the available space in disk and RAM (physical memory)\n",
    "make up the virtual memory, which is an abstraction of the total\n",
    "resources available. In short, the virtual memory makes it so that the\n",
    "available space is larger than what can be found on RAM in isolation and\n",
    "creates the illusion that the main memory is larger than it actually is.\n",
    "\n",
    "In normal circumstances, a regular CPU tensor is pageable which means\n",
    "that it is divided in blocks called pages that can live anywhere in the\n",
    "virtual memory (both in RAM or on disk). As mentioned earlier, this has\n",
    "the advantage that the memory seems larger than what the main memory\n",
    "actually is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, when a program accesses a page that is not in RAM, a \\\"page\n",
    "fault\\\" occurs and the operating system (OS) then brings back this page\n",
    "into RAM (\\\"swap in\\\" or \\\"page in\\\"). In turn, the OS may have to swap\n",
    "out (or \\\"page out\\\") another page to make room for the new page.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to pageable memory, a pinned (or page-locked or\n",
    "non-pageable) memory is a type of memory that cannot be swapped out to\n",
    "disk. It allows for faster and more predictable access times, but has\n",
    "the downside that it is more limited than the pageable memory (aka the\n",
    "main memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/_static/img/pinmem/pinmem.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "CUDA and (non-)pageable memory\n",
    "------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how CUDA copies a tensor from CPU to CUDA, let\\'s consider\n",
    "the two scenarios above:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If the memory is page-locked, the device can access the memory\n",
    "    directly in the main memory. The memory addresses are well defined\n",
    "    and functions that need to read these data can be significantly\n",
    "    accelerated.\n",
    "-   If the memory is pageable, all the pages will have to be brought to\n",
    "    the main memory before being sent to the GPU. This operation may\n",
    "    take time and is less predictable than when executed on page-locked\n",
    "    tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, when CUDA sends pageable data from CPU to GPU, it must\n",
    "first create a page-locked copy of that data before making the transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Operations with `non_blocking=True` (CUDA `cudaMemcpyAsync`)\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "When executing a copy from a host (e.g., CPU) to a device (e.g., GPU),\n",
    "the CUDA toolkit offers modalities to do these operations synchronously\n",
    "or asynchronously with respect to the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, when calling `~torch.Tensor.to`{.interpreted-text\n",
    "role=\"meth\"}, PyTorch always makes a call to\n",
    "[cudaMemcpyAsync](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/group__CUDART__MEMORY.html#group__CUDART__MEMORY_1g85073372f776b4c4d5f89f7124b7bf79).\n",
    "If `non_blocking=False` (default), a `cudaStreamSynchronize` will be\n",
    "called after each and every `cudaMemcpyAsync`, making the call to\n",
    "`~torch.Tensor.to`{.interpreted-text role=\"meth\"} blocking in the main\n",
    "thread. If `non_blocking=True`, no synchronization is triggered, and the\n",
    "main thread on the host is not blocked. Therefore, from the host\n",
    "perspective, multiple tensors can be sent to the device simultaneously,\n",
    "as the thread does not need to wait for one transfer to be completed to\n",
    "initiate the other.\n",

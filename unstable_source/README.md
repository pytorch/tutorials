# Prototype Tutorials and Recipes

This directory contains tutorials and recipes demonstrating prototype features in PyTorch. 

**Prototype features** are part of the release and are available as part of the binary distributions such as PyPI or Conda. To test these features you can, depending on the feature, build from the master branch or use the nightly wheels that are made available at pytorch.org. You can also by use the release wheels available from PyPI or Conda. Prototype features are provided as a technical preview and can be altered later on. The PyTorch team does not recommend using them in production pipelines.

These are intentionally left out of the pytorch.org/tutorials build and will not show up on the website.

*Level of commitment:* We are committing to gathering high bandwidth feedback only on these features. Based on this feedback and potential further engagement between community members, we as a community will decide if we want to upgrade the level of commitment or to fail fast.

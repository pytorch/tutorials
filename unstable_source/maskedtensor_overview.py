######################################################################
# This tutorial is designed to serve as a starting point for using MaskedTensors
# and discuss its masking semantics.
#
# MaskedTensor serves as an extension to :class:`torch.Tensor` that provides the user with the ability to:
#
# * use any masked semantics (for example, variable length tensors, nan* operators, etc.)
# * differentiation between 0 and NaN gradients
# * various sparse applications (see tutorial below)
#
# For a more detailed introduction on what MaskedTensors are, please find the
# `torch.masked documentation <https://pytorch.org/docs/master/masked.html>`__.
#
# Using MaskedTensor
# ==================
#
# In this section we discuss how to use MaskedTensor including how to construct, access, the data
# and mask, as well as indexing and slicing.
#
# Preparation
# -----------
#
# We'll begin by doing the necessary setup for the tutorial:
#

import torch
from torch.masked import masked_tensor, as_masked_tensor
import warnings

# Disable prototype warnings and such
warnings.filterwarnings(action='ignore', category=UserWarning)

######################################################################
# Construction
# ------------
#
# There are a few different ways to construct a MaskedTensor:
#
# * The first way is to directly invoke the MaskedTensor class
# * The second (and our recommended way) is to use :func:`masked.masked_tensor` and :func:`masked.as_masked_tensor`
#   factory functions, which are analogous to :func:`torch.tensor` and :func:`torch.as_tensor`
#
# Throughout this tutorial, we will be assuming the import line: `from torch.masked import masked_tensor`.
#
# Accessing the data and mask
# ---------------------------
#
# The underlying fields in a MaskedTensor can be accessed through:
#
# * the :meth:`MaskedTensor.get_data` function
# * the :meth:`MaskedTensor.get_mask` function. Recall that ``True`` indicates "specified" or "valid"
#   while ``False`` indicates "unspecified" or "invalid".
#
# In general, the underlying data that is returned may not be valid in the unspecified entries, so we recommend that
# when users require a Tensor without any masked entries, that they use :meth:`MaskedTensor.to_tensor` (as shown above) to
# return a Tensor with filled values.
#
# Indexing and slicing
# --------------------
#
# :class:`MaskedTensor` is a Tensor subclass, which means that it inherits the same semantics for indexing and slicing
# as :class:`torch.Tensor`. Below are some examples of common indexing and slicing patterns:
#

data = torch.arange(24).reshape(2, 3, 4)
mask = data % 2 == 0

print("data:\n", data)
print("mask:\n", mask)

######################################################################
#

# float is used for cleaner visualization when being printed
mt = masked_tensor(data.float(), mask)

print("mt[0]:\n", mt[0])
print("mt[:, :, 2:4]:\n", mt[:, :, 2:4])

######################################################################
# Why is MaskedTensor useful?
# ===========================
#
# Because of :class:`MaskedTensor`'s treatment of specified and unspecified values as a first-class citizen
# instead of an afterthought (with filled values, nans, etc.), it is able to solve for several of the shortcomings
# that regular Tensors are unable to; indeed, :class:`MaskedTensor` was born in a large part due to these recurring issues.
#
# Below, we will discuss some of the most common issues that are still unresolved in PyTorch today
# and illustrate how :class:`MaskedTensor` can solve these problems.
#
# Distinguishing between 0 and NaN gradient
# -----------------------------------------
#
# One issue that :class:`torch.Tensor` runs into is the inability to distinguish between gradients that are
# undefined (NaN) vs. gradients that are actually 0. Because PyTorch does not have a way of marking a value
# as specified/valid vs. unspecified/invalid, it is forced to rely on NaN or 0 (depending on the use case), leading
# to unreliable semantics since many operations aren't meant to handle NaN values properly. What is even more confusing
# is that sometimes depending on the order of operations, the gradient could vary (for example, depending on how early
# in the chain of operations a NaN value manifests).
#
# :class:`MaskedTensor` is the perfect solution for this!
#
# torch.where
# ^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# In `Issue 10729 <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/10729>`__, we notice a case where the order of operations
# can matter when using :func:`torch.where` because we have trouble differentiating between if the 0 is a real 0
# or one from undefined gradients. Therefore, we remain consistent and mask out the results:
#
# Current result:
#

x = torch.tensor([-10., -5, 0, 5, 10, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100], requires_grad=True, dtype=torch.float)
y = torch.where(x < 0, torch.exp(x), torch.ones_like(x))
y.sum().backward()
x.grad

######################################################################
# :class:`MaskedTensor` result:
#

x = torch.tensor([-10., -5, 0, 5, 10, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100])
mask = x < 0
mx = masked_tensor(x, mask, requires_grad=True)
my = masked_tensor(torch.ones_like(x), ~mask, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.where(mask, torch.exp(mx), my)
y.sum().backward()
mx.grad

######################################################################
# The gradient here is only provided to the selected subset. Effectively, this changes the gradient of `where`
# to mask out elements instead of setting them to zero.
#
# Another torch.where
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# `Issue 52248 <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/52248>`__ is another example.
#
# Current result:
#

a = torch.randn((), requires_grad=True)
b = torch.tensor(False)
c = torch.ones(())
print("torch.where(b, a/0, c):\n", torch.where(b, a/0, c))
print("torch.autograd.grad(torch.where(b, a/0, c), a):\n", torch.autograd.grad(torch.where(b, a/0, c), a))

######################################################################
# :class:`MaskedTensor` result:
#

a = masked_tensor(torch.randn(()), torch.tensor(True), requires_grad=True)
b = torch.tensor(False)
c = torch.ones(())
print("torch.where(b, a/0, c):\n", torch.where(b, a/0, c))
print("torch.autograd.grad(torch.where(b, a/0, c), a):\n", torch.autograd.grad(torch.where(b, a/0, c), a))

######################################################################
# This issue is similar (and even links to the next issue below) in that it expresses frustration with
# unexpected behavior because of the inability to differentiate "no gradient" vs "zero gradient",
# which in turn makes working with other ops difficult to reason about.
#
# When using mask, x/0 yields NaN grad
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# In `Issue 4132 <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/4132>`__, the user proposes that
# `x.grad` should be `[0, 1]` instead of the `[nan, 1]`,
# whereas :class:`MaskedTensor` makes this very clear by masking out the gradient altogether.
#
# Current result:
#

x = torch.tensor([1., 1.], requires_grad=True)
div = torch.tensor([0., 1.])
y = x/div # => y is [inf, 1]
mask = (div != 0)  # => mask is [0, 1]
y[mask].backward()
x.grad

######################################################################
# :class:`MaskedTensor` result:
#

x = torch.tensor([1., 1.], requires_grad=True)
div = torch.tensor([0., 1.])
y = x/div # => y is [inf, 1]
mask = (div != 0) # => mask is [0, 1]
loss = as_masked_tensor(y, mask)
loss.sum().backward()
x.grad

######################################################################
# :func:`torch.nansum` and :func:`torch.nanmean`
# ----------------------------------------------
#
# In `Issue 67180 <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/67180>`__,
# the gradient isn't calculate properly (a longstanding issue), whereas :class:`MaskedTensor` handles it correctly.
#
# Current result:
#

a = torch.tensor([1., 2., float('nan')])
b = torch.tensor(1.0, requires_grad=True)
c = a * b
c1 = torch.nansum(c)
bgrad1, = torch.autograd.grad(c1, b, retain_graph=True)
bgrad1

######################################################################
# :class:`MaskedTensor` result:
#

a = torch.tensor([1., 2., float('nan')])
b = torch.tensor(1.0, requires_grad=True)
mt = masked_tensor(a, ~torch.isnan(a))
c = mt * b
c1 = torch.sum(c)
bgrad1, = torch.autograd.grad(c1, b, retain_graph=True)
bgrad1

######################################################################
# Safe Softmax
# ------------
#
# Safe softmax is another great example of `an issue <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/55056>`__
# that arises frequently. In a nutshell, if there is an entire batch that is "masked out"
# or consists entirely of padding (which, in the softmax case, translates to being set `-inf`),
# then this will result in NaNs, which can lead to training divergence.
#
# Luckily, :class:`MaskedTensor` has solved this issue. Consider this setup:
#

data = torch.randn(3, 3)
mask = torch.tensor([[True, False, False], [True, False, True], [False, False, False]])
x = data.masked_fill(~mask, float('-inf'))
mt = masked_tensor(data, mask)
print("x:\n", x)
print("mt:\n", mt)

######################################################################
# For example, we want to calculate the softmax along `dim=0`. Note that the second column is "unsafe" (i.e. entirely
# masked out), so when the softmax is calculated, the result will yield `0/0 = nan` since `exp(-inf) = 0`.
# However, what we would really like is for the gradients to be masked out since they are unspecified and would be
# invalid for training.
#
# PyTorch result:
#

x.softmax(0)

######################################################################
# :class:`MaskedTensor` result:
#

mt.softmax(0)

######################################################################
# Implementing missing torch.nan* operators
# -----------------------------------------
#
# In `Issue 61474 <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/61474>`__,
# there is a request to add additional operators to cover the various `torch.nan*` applications,
# such as ``torch.nanmax``, ``torch.nanmin``, etc.
#
# In general, these problems lend themselves more naturally to masked semantics, so instead of introducing additional
# operators, we propose using :class:`MaskedTensor` instead.
# Since `nanmean has already landed <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/21987>`__,
# we can use it as a comparison point:
#

x = torch.arange(16).float()
y = x * x.fmod(4)
z = y.masked_fill(y == 0, float('nan'))  # we want to get the mean of y when ignoring the zeros

######################################################################
#
print("y:\n", y)
# z is just y with the zeros replaced with nan's
print("z:\n", z)

######################################################################
#

print("y.mean():\n", y.mean())
print("z.nanmean():\n", z.nanmean())
# MaskedTensor successfully ignores the 0's
print("torch.mean(masked_tensor(y, y != 0)):\n", torch.mean(masked_tensor(y, y != 0)))

######################################################################
# In the above example, we've constructed a `y` and would like to calculate the mean of the series while ignoring
# the zeros. `torch.nanmean` can be used to do this, but we don't have implementations for the rest of the
# `torch.nan*` operations. :class:`MaskedTensor` solves this issue by being able to use the base operation,
# and we already have support for the other operations listed in the issue. For example:
#

torch.argmin(masked_tensor(y, y != 0))

######################################################################
# Indeed, the index of the minimum argument when ignoring the 0's is the 1 in index 1.
#
# :class:`MaskedTensor` can also support reductions when the data is fully masked out, which is equivalent
# to the case above when the data Tensor is completely ``nan``. ``nanmean`` would return ``nan``
# (an ambiguous return value), while MaskedTensor would more accurately indicate a masked out result.
#

x = torch.empty(16).fill_(float('nan'))
print("x:\n", x)
print("torch.nanmean(x):\n", torch.nanmean(x))
print("torch.nanmean via maskedtensor:\n", torch.mean(masked_tensor(x, ~torch.isnan(x))))

######################################################################
# This is a similar problem to safe softmax where `0/0 = nan` when what we really want is an undefined value.

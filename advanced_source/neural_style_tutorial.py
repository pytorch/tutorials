Introduction
------------

This tutorial explains how to implement the `Neural-Style algorithm <https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576>`__
developed by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge.
Neural-Style, or Neural-Transfer, allows you to take an image and
reproduce it with a new artistic style. The algorithm takes three images,
an input image, a content-image, and a style-image, and changes the input 
to resemble the content of the content-image and the artistic style of the style-image.

# Underlying Principle
# --------------------
# 
# The principle is simple: we define two distances, one for the content
# (:math:`D_C`) and one for the style (:math:`D_S`). :math:`D_C` measures how different the content
# is between two images while :math:`D_S` measures how different the style is
# between two images. Then, we take a third image, the input, and
# transform it to minimize both its content-distance with the
# content-image and its style-distance with the style-image. Now we can
# import the necessary packages and begin the neural transfer.
# 
# Importing Packages and Selecting a Device
# -----------------------------------------
# Below is a  list of the packages needed to implement the neural transfer.
#
# -  ``torch``, ``torch.nn``, ``numpy`` (indispensables packages for
#    neural networks with PyTorch)
# -  ``torch.optim`` (efficient gradient descents)
# -  ``PIL``, ``PIL.Image``, ``matplotlib.pyplot`` (load and display
#    images)
# -  ``torchvision.transforms`` (transform PIL images into tensors)
# -  ``torchvision.models`` (train or load pre-trained models)
# -  ``copy`` (to deep copy the models; system package)

from __future__ import print_function

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import torch.optim as optim

from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import torchvision.models as models

import copy


######################################################################
# Next, we need to choose which device to run the network on and import the
# content and style images. Running the neural transfer algorithm on large
# images takes longer and will go much faster when running on a GPU. We can
# use ``torch.cuda.is_available()`` to detect if there is a GPU available.
# Next, we set the ``torch.device`` for use throughout the tutorial. Also the ``.to(device)``
# method is used to move tensors or modules to a desired device. 

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

######################################################################
# Loading the Images
# ------------------
#
# Now we will import the style and content images. The original PIL images have values between 0 and 255, but when
# transformed into torch tensors, their values are converted to be between
# 0 and 1. The images also need to be resized to have the same dimensions.
# An important detail to note is that neural networks from the
# torch library are trained with tensor values ranging from 0 to 1. If you
# try to feed the networks with 0 to 255 tensor images, then the activated
# feature maps will be unable sense the intended content and style.
# However, pre-trained networks from the Caffe library are trained with 0
# to 255 tensor images. 
#
#
# .. Note::
#     Here are links to download the images required to run the tutorial:
#     `picasso.jpg <http://pytorch.org/tutorials/_static/img/neural-style/picasso.jpg>`__ and
#     `dancing.jpg <http://pytorch.org/tutorials/_static/img/neural-style/dancing.jpg>`__.
#     Download these two images and add them to a directory
#     with name ``images`` in your current working directory.

# desired size of the output image
imsize = 512 if torch.cuda.is_available() else 128  # use small size if no gpu

loader = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(imsize),  # scale imported image
    transforms.ToTensor()])  # transform it into a torch tensor


def image_loader(image_name):
    image = Image.open(image_name)
    # fake batch dimension required to fit network's input dimensions
    image = loader(image).unsqueeze(0)
    return image.to(device, torch.float)


style_img = image_loader("./images/picasso.jpg")
content_img = image_loader("./images/dancing.jpg")

assert style_img.size() == content_img.size(), \
    "we need to import style and content images of the same size"


######################################################################
# Now, let's create a function that displays an image by reconverting a 
# copy of it to PIL format and displaying the copy using 
# ``plt.imshow``. We will try displaying the content and style images 
# to ensure they were imported correctly.

unloader = transforms.ToPILImage()  # reconvert into PIL image

plt.ion()

def imshow(tensor, title=None):
    image = tensor.cpu().clone()  # we clone the tensor to not do changes on it
    image = image.squeeze(0)      # remove the fake batch dimension
    image = unloader(image)
    plt.imshow(image)
    if title is not None:
        plt.title(title)
    plt.pause(0.001) # pause a bit so that plots are updated


plt.figure()
imshow(style_img, title='Style Image')

imshow(content_img, title='Content Image')

######################################################################
# Loss Functions
# --------------
# Content Loss
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# The content loss is a function that represents a weighted version of the
# content distance for an individual layer. The function takes the feature
# maps :math:`F_{XL}` of a layer :math:`L` in a network processing input :math:`X` and returns the
# weighted content distance :math:`w_{CL}.D_C^L(X,C)` between the image :math:`X` and the
# content image :math:`C`. The feature maps of the content image(:math:`F_{CL}`) must be
# known by the function in order to calculate the content distance. We
# implement this function as a torch module with a constructor that takes
# :math:`F_{CL}` as an input. The distance :math:`\|F_{XL} - F_{CL}\|^2` is the mean square error
# between the two sets of feature maps, and can be computed using ``nn.MSELoss``.
# 
# We will add this content loss module directly after the convolution
# layer(s) that are being used to compute the content distance. This way
# each time the network is fed an input image the content losses will be
# computed at the desired layers and because of auto grad, all the
# gradients will be computed. Now, in order to make the content loss layer
# transparent we must define a ``forward`` method that computes the content
# loss and then returns the layer’s input. The computed loss is saved as a
# parameter of the module.
# 

class ContentLoss(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self, target,):
        super(ContentLoss, self).__init__()
        # we 'detach' the target content from the tree used
        # to dynamically compute the gradient: this is a stated value,
        # not a variable. Otherwise the forward method of the criterion
        # will throw an error.
        self.target = target.detach()

    def forward(self, input):
        self.loss = F.mse_loss(input, self.target)
        return input

######################################################################
# .. Note::
#    **Important detail**: although this module is named ``ContentLoss``, it
#    is not a true PyTorch Loss function. If you want to define your content
#    loss as a PyTorch Loss function, you have to create a PyTorch autograd function 
#    to recompute/implement the gradient manually in the ``backward``
#    method.

######################################################################
# Style Loss
# ~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# The style loss module is implemented similarly to the content loss
# module. It will act as a transparent layer in a
# network that computes the style loss of that layer. In order to
# calculate the style loss, we need to compute the gram matrix :math:`G_{XL}`. A gram
# matrix is the result of multiplying a given matrix by its transposed
# matrix. In this application the given matrix is a reshaped version of
# the feature maps :math:`F_{XL}` of a layer :math:`L`. :math:`F_{XL}` is reshaped to form :math:`\hat{F}_{XL}`, a :math:`K`\ x\ :math:`N`
# matrix, where :math:`K` is the number of feature maps at layer :math:`L` and :math:`N` is the
# length of any vectorized feature map :math:`F_{XL}^k`. For example, the first line
# of :math:`\hat{F}_{XL}` corresponds to the first vectorized feature map :math:`F_{XL}^1`.
# 
# Finally, the gram matrix must be normalized by dividing each element by
# the total number of elements in the matrix. This normalization is to
# counteract the fact that :math:`\hat{F}_{XL}` matrices with a large :math:`N` dimension yield
# larger values in the Gram matrix. These larger values will cause the
# first layers (before pooling layers) to have a larger impact during the
# gradient descent. Style features tend to be in the deeper layers of the
# network so this normalization step is crucial.
# 

def gram_matrix(input):
    a, b, c, d = input.size()  # a=batch size(=1)
    # b=number of feature maps
    # (c,d)=dimensions of a f. map (N=c*d)

    features = input.view(a * b, c * d)  # resise F_XL into \hat F_XL

    G = torch.mm(features, features.t())  # compute the gram product

    # we 'normalize' the values of the gram matrix
    # by dividing by the number of element in each feature maps.
    return G.div(a * b * c * d)


######################################################################
# Now the style loss module looks almost exactly like the content loss
# module. The style distance is also computed using the mean square
# error between :math:`G_{XL}` and :math:`G_{SL}`.
# 

class StyleLoss(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self, target_feature):
        super(StyleLoss, self).__init__()
        self.target = gram_matrix(target_feature).detach()

    def forward(self, input):
        G = gram_matrix(input)
        self.loss = F.mse_loss(G, self.target)
        return input


######################################################################
# Importing the Model
# -------------------
# 
# Now we need to import a pre-trained neural network. We will use a 19
# layer VGG network like the one used in the paper.
# 
# PyTorch’s implementation of VGG is a module divided into two child
# ``Sequential`` modules: ``features`` (containing convolution and pooling layers),
# and ``classifier`` (containing fully connected layers). We will use the
# ``features`` module because we need the output of the individual
# convolution layers to measure content and style loss. Some layers have
# different behavior during training than evaluation, so we must set the
# network to evaluation mode using ``.eval()``.
# 

cnn = models.vgg19(pretrained=True).features.to(device).eval()



######################################################################
# Additionally, VGG networks are trained on images with each channel
# normalized by mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225].
# We will use them to normalize the image before sending it into the network.
# 

cnn_normalization_mean = torch.tensor([0.485, 0.456, 0.406]).to(device)
cnn_normalization_std = torch.tensor([0.229, 0.224, 0.225]).to(device)

# create a module to normalize input image so we can easily put it in a
# nn.Sequential
class Normalization(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, mean, std):
        super(Normalization, self).__init__()
        # .view the mean and std to make them [C x 1 x 1] so that they can
        # directly work with image Tensor of shape [B x C x H x W].
        # B is batch size. C is number of channels. H is height and W is width.
        self.mean = torch.tensor(mean).view(-1, 1, 1)
        self.std = torch.tensor(std).view(-1, 1, 1)

    def forward(self, img):
        # normalize img
        return (img - self.mean) / self.std


######################################################################
# A ``Sequential`` module contains an ordered list of child modules. For
# instance, ``vgg19.features`` contains a sequence (Conv2d, ReLU, MaxPool2d,
# Conv2d, ReLU…) aligned in the right order of depth. We need to add our
# content loss and style loss layers immediately after the convolution
# layer they are detecting. To do this we must create a new ``Sequential``

# As Leon Gatys, the author of the algorithm, suggested `here <https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/pytorch-tutorial-for-neural-transfert-of-artistic-style/336/20?u=alexis-jacq>`__, we will use
# L-BFGS algorithm to run our gradient descent. Unlike training a network,
# we want to train the input image in order to minimise the content/style
# losses. We will create a PyTorch L-BFGS optimizer ``optim.LBFGS`` and pass
# our image to it as the tensor to optimize.

# Finally, we must define a function that performs the neural transfer. For
# each iteration of the networks, it is fed an updated input and computes
# new losses. We will run the ``backward`` methods of each loss module to
# dynamicaly compute their gradients. The optimizer requires a “closure”
# function, which reevaluates the modul and returns the loss.
# 
# We still have one final constraint to address. The network may try to
# optimize the input with values that exceed the 0 to 1 tensor range for
# the image. We can address this by correcting the input values to be
# between 0 to 1 each time the network is run.

Extending TorchScript with Custom C++ Classes
===============================================

.. warning:: TorchScript is no longer in active development.

This tutorial is a follow-on to the
:doc:`custom operator <torch_script_custom_ops>`
tutorial, and introduces the API we've built for binding C++ classes into TorchScript
and Python simultaneously. The API is very similar to
`pybind11 <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11>`_, and most of the concepts will transfer
over if you're familiar with that system.

Implementing and Binding the Class in C++
-----------------------------------------

For this tutorial, we are going to define a simple C++ class that maintains persistent
state in a member variable.

.. literalinclude:: ../advanced_source/torch_script_custom_classes/custom_class_project/class.cpp
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: BEGIN class
  :end-before: END class

There are several things to note:

- ``torch/custom_class.h`` is the header you need to include to extend TorchScript
  with your custom class.
- Notice that whenever we are working with instances of the custom
  class, we do it via instances of ``c10::intrusive_ptr<>``. Think of ``intrusive_ptr``
  as a smart pointer like ``std::shared_ptr``, but the reference count is stored
  directly in the object, as opposed to a separate metadata block (as is done in
  ``std::shared_ptr``.  ``torch::Tensor`` internally uses the same pointer type;
  and custom classes have to also use this pointer type so that we can
  consistently manage different object types.
- The second thing to notice is that the user-defined class must inherit from
  ``torch::CustomClassHolder``. This ensures that the custom class has space to
  store the reference count.

Now let's take a look at how we will make this class visible to TorchScript, a process called
*binding* the class:

.. literalinclude:: ../advanced_source/torch_script_custom_classes/custom_class_project/class.cpp
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: BEGIN binding
  :end-before: END binding
  :append:
      ;
    }



Building the Example as a C++ Project With CMake
------------------------------------------------

Now, we're going to build the above C++ code with the `CMake
<https://cmake.org>`_ build system. First, take all the C++ code
we've covered so far and place it in a file called ``class.cpp``.
Then, write a simple ``CMakeLists.txt`` file and place it in the
same directory. Here is what ``CMakeLists.txt`` should look like:

.. literalinclude:: ../advanced_source/torch_script_custom_classes/custom_class_project/CMakeLists.txt
  :language: cmake

Also, create a ``build`` directory. Your file tree should look like this::

  custom_class_project/
    class.cpp
    CMakeLists.txt
    build/

We assume you've setup your environment in the same way as described in
the :doc:`previous tutorial <torch_script_custom_ops>`.
Go ahead and invoke cmake and then make to build the project:

.. code-block:: shell

  $ cd build
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(python -c 'import torch.utils; print(torch.utils.cmake_prefix_path)')" ..
    -- The C compiler identification is GNU 7.3.1

    -- Found Threads: TRUE

  $ make -j

    [ 50%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/custom_class.dir/class.cpp.o
    [100%] Linking CXX shared library libcustom_class.so
    [100%] Built target custom_class

What you'll find is there is now (among other things) a dynamic library
file present in the build directory. On Linux, this is probably named
``libcustom_class.so``. So the file tree should look like::

  custom_class_project/
    class.cpp
    CMakeLists.txt
    build/
      libcustom_class.so

Using the C++ Class from Python and TorchScript
-----------------------------------------------

Now that we have our class and its registration compiled into an ``.so`` file,
we can load that `.so` into Python and try it out. Here's a script that
demonstrates that:

.. literalinclude:: ../advanced_source/torch_script_custom_classes/custom_class_project/custom_test.py
  :language: python


Saving, Loading, and Running TorchScript Code Using Custom Classes
------------------------------------------------------------------

We can also use custom-registered C++ classes in a C++ process using
libtorch. As an example, let's define a simple ``nn.Module`` that
instantiates and calls a method on our MyStackClass class:

.. literalinclude:: ../advanced_source/torch_script_custom_classes/custom_class_project/save.py
  :language: python

``foo.pt`` in our filesystem now contains the serialized TorchScript
program we've just defined.

Now, we're going to define a new CMake project to show how you can load
this model and its required .so file. For a full treatment of how to do this,
please have a look at the `Loading a TorchScript Model in C++ Tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html>`_.

Similarly to before, let's create a file structure containing the following::

  cpp_inference_example/
    infer.cpp
    CMakeLists.txt
    foo.pt
    build/
    custom_class_project/
      class.cpp
      CMakeLists.txt
      build/

Notice we've copied over the serialized ``foo.pt`` file, as well as the source
tree from the ``custom_class_project`` above. We will be adding the
``custom_class_project`` as a dependency to this C++ project so that we can
build the custom class into the binary.

Let's populate ``infer.cpp`` with the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../advanced_source/torch_script_custom_classes/infer.cpp
  :language: cpp

And similarly let's define our CMakeLists.txt file:

.. literalinclude:: ../advanced_source/torch_script_custom_classes/CMakeLists.txt
  :language: cpp

You know the drill: ``cd build``, ``cmake``, and ``make``:

.. code-block:: shell

  $ cd build
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(python -c 'import torch.utils; print(torch.utils.cmake_prefix_path)')" ..
    -- The C compiler identification is GNU 7.3.1

  $ make -j

    [ 75%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/infer.dir/infer.cpp.o

And now we can run our exciting C++ binary:

.. code-block:: shell

  $ ./infer
    momfoobarbaz

Incredible!

Moving Custom Classes To/From IValues
-------------------------------------

It's also possible that you may need to move custom classes into or out of
``IValue``s, such as when you take or return ``IValue``s from TorchScript methods
or you want to instantiate a custom class attribute in C++. For creating an
``IValue`` from a custom C++ class instance:

- ``torch::make_custom_class<T>()`` provides an API similar to c10::intrusive_ptr<T>
  in that it will take whatever set of arguments you provide to it, call the constructor
  of T that matches that set of arguments, and wrap that instance up and return it.
  However, instead of returning just a pointer to a custom class object, it returns
  an ``IValue`` wrapping the object. You can then pass this ``IValue`` directly to
  TorchScript.
- In the event that you already have an ``intrusive_ptr`` pointing to your class, you
  can directly construct an IValue from it using the constructor ``IValue(intrusive_ptr<T>)``.

For converting ``IValue`` back to custom classes:

- ``IValue::toCustomClass<T>()`` will return an ``intrusive_ptr<T>`` pointing to the
  custom class that the ``IValue`` contains. Internally, this function is checking
  that ``T`` is registered as a custom class and that the ``IValue`` does in fact contain
  a custom class. You can check whether the ``IValue`` contains a custom class manually by
  calling ``isCustomClass()``.

Defining Serialization/Deserialization Methods for Custom C++ Classes
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you try to save a ``ScriptModule`` with a custom-bound C++ class as
an attribute, you'll get the following error:

.. literalinclude:: ../advanced_source/torch_script_custom_classes/custom_class_project/export_attr.py
  :language: python

.. code-block:: shell

  $ python export_attr.py
  RuntimeError: Cannot serialize custom bound C++ class __torch__.torch.classes.my_classes.MyStackClass. Please define serialization methods via def_pickle for this class. (pushIValueImpl at ../torch/csrc/jit/pickler.cpp:128)

This is because TorchScript cannot automatically figure out what information
save from your C++ class. You must specify that manually. The way to do that
is to define ``__getstate__`` and ``__setstate__`` methods on the class using
the special ``def_pickle`` method on ``class_``.

.. note::
  The semantics of ``__getstate__`` and ``__setstate__`` in TorchScript are
  equivalent to that of the Python pickle module. You can
  `read more <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/csrc/jit/docs/serialization.md#getstate-and-setstate>`_
  about how we use these methods.

Here is an example of the ``def_pickle`` call we can add to the registration of
``MyStackClass`` to include serialization methods:

.. literalinclude:: ../advanced_source/torch_script_custom_classes/custom_class_project/class.cpp
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: BEGIN def_pickle
  :end-before: END def_pickle

.. note::
  We take a different approach from pybind11 in the pickle API. Whereas pybind11
  as a special function ``pybind11::pickle()`` which you pass into ``class_::def()``,
  we have a separate method ``def_pickle`` for this purpose. This is because the
  name ``torch::jit::pickle`` was already taken, and we didn't want to cause confusion.

Once we have defined the (de)serialization behavior in this way, our script can
now run successfully:

.. code-block:: shell

  $ python ../export_attr.py
  testing

Defining Custom Operators that Take or Return Bound C++ Classes
---------------------------------------------------------------

Once you've defined a custom C++ class, you can also use that class
as an argument or return from a custom operator (i.e. free functions). Suppose
you have the following free function:

.. literalinclude:: ../advanced_source/torch_script_custom_classes/custom_class_project/class.cpp
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: BEGIN free_function
  :end-before: END free_function

You can register it running the following code inside your ``TORCH_LIBRARY``
block:

.. literalinclude:: ../advanced_source/torch_script_custom_classes/custom_class_project/class.cpp
  :language: cpp
  :start-after: BEGIN def_free
  :end-before: END def_free

Refer to the `custom op tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/torch_script_custom_ops.html>`_
for more details on the registration API.

Once this is done, you can use the op like the following example:

.. code-block:: python

  class TryCustomOp(torch.nn.Module):
      def __init__(self):
          super(TryCustomOp, self).__init__()
          self.f = torch.classes.my_classes.MyStackClass(["foo", "bar"])

      def forward(self):
          return torch.ops.my_classes.manipulate_instance(self.f)

.. note::

  Registration of an operator that takes a C++ class as an argument requires that
  the custom class has already been registered.  You can enforce this by
  making sure the custom class registration and your free function definitions
  are in the same ``TORCH_LIBRARY`` block, and that the custom class
  registration comes first.  In the future, we may relax this requirement,
  so that these can be registered in any order.


Conclusion
----------

This tutorial walked you through how to expose a C++ class to TorchScript
(and by extension Python), how to register its methods, how to use that
class from Python and TorchScript, and how to save and load code using
the class and run that code in a standalone C++ process. You are now ready
to extend your TorchScript models with C++ classes that interface with
third party C++ libraries or implement any other use case that requires the
lines between Python, TorchScript and C++ to blend smoothly.

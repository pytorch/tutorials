Loading a TorchScript Model in C++
=====================================

.. warning:: TorchScript is no longer in active development.

As its name suggests, the primary interface to PyTorch is the Python
programming language. While Python is a suitable and preferred language for
many scenarios requiring dynamism and ease of iteration, there are equally many
situations where precisely these properties of Python are unfavorable. One
environment in which the latter often applies is *production* -- the land of
low latencies and strict deployment requirements. For production scenarios, C++
is very often the language of choice, even if only to bind it into another
language like Java, Rust or Go. The following paragraphs will outline the path
PyTorch provides to go from an existing Python model to a serialized
representation that can be *loaded* and *executed* purely from C++, with no
dependency on Python.

Step 1: Converting Your PyTorch Model to Torch Script
-----------------------------------------------------

A PyTorch model's journey from Python to C++ is enabled by `Torch Script
<https://pytorch.org/docs/master/jit.html>`_, a representation of a PyTorch
model that can be understood, compiled and serialized by the Torch Script
compiler. If you are starting out from an existing PyTorch model written in the
vanilla "eager" API, you must first convert your model to Torch Script. In the
most common cases, discussed below, this requires only little effort. If you
already have a Torch Script module, you can skip to the next section of this
tutorial.

There exist two ways of converting a PyTorch model to Torch Script. The first
is known as *tracing*, a mechanism in which the structure of the model is
captured by evaluating it once using example inputs, and recording the flow of
those inputs through the model. This is suitable for models that make limited
use of control flow. The second approach is to add explicit annotations to your
model that inform the Torch Script compiler that it may directly parse and
compile your model code, subject to the constraints imposed by the Torch Script
language.

.. tip::

  You can find the complete documentation for both of these methods, as well as
  further guidance on which to use, in the official `Torch Script
  reference <https://pytorch.org/docs/master/jit.html>`_.

Converting to Torch Script via Tracing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To convert a PyTorch model to Torch Script via tracing, you must pass an
instance of your model along with an example input to the ``torch.jit.trace``
function. This will produce a ``torch.jit.ScriptModule`` object with the trace
of your model evaluation embedded in the module's ``forward`` method::

  import torch
  import torchvision

  # An instance of your model.
  model = torchvision.models.resnet18()

  # An example input you would normally provide to your model's forward() method.
  example = torch.rand(1, 3, 224, 224)

  # Use torch.jit.trace to generate a torch.jit.ScriptModule via tracing.
  traced_script_module = torch.jit.trace(model, example)

The traced ``ScriptModule`` can now be evaluated identically to a regular
PyTorch module::

  In[1]: output = traced_script_module(torch.ones(1, 3, 224, 224))
  In[2]: output[0, :5]
  Out[2]: tensor([-0.2698, -0.0381,  0.4023, -0.3010, -0.0448], grad_fn=<SliceBackward>)

Converting to Torch Script via Annotation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under certain circumstances, such as if your model employs particular forms of
control flow, you may want to write your model in Torch Script directly and
annotate your model accordingly. For example, say you have the following
vanilla Pytorch model::

  import torch

  class MyModule(torch.nn.Module):
      def __init__(self, N, M):
          super(MyModule, self).__init__()
          self.weight = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.rand(N, M))

      def forward(self, input):
          if input.sum() > 0:
            output = self.weight.mv(input)
          else:
            output = self.weight + input
          return output


Because the ``forward`` method of this module uses control flow that is
dependent on the input, it is not suitable for tracing. Instead, we can convert
it to a ``ScriptModule``.
In order to convert the module to the ``ScriptModule``, one needs to
compile the module with ``torch.jit.script`` as follows::

    class MyModule(torch.nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, N, M):
            super(MyModule, self).__init__()
            self.weight = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.rand(N, M))

        def forward(self, input):
            if input.sum() > 0:
              output = self.weight.mv(input)
            else:
              output = self.weight + input
            return output

    my_module = MyModule(10,20)
    sm = torch.jit.script(my_module)

If you need to exclude some methods in your ``nn.Module``
because they use Python features that TorchScript doesn't support yet,
you could annotate those with ``@torch.jit.ignore``

``sm`` is an instance of
``ScriptModule`` that is ready for serialization.

Step 2: Serializing Your Script Module to a File
-------------------------------------------------

Once you have a ``ScriptModule`` in your hands, either from tracing or
annotating a PyTorch model, you are ready to serialize it to a file. Later on,
you'll be able to load the module from this file in C++ and execute it without
any dependency on Python. Say we want to serialize the ``ResNet18`` model shown
earlier in the tracing example. To perform this serialization, simply call
`save <https://pytorch.org/docs/master/jit.html#torch.jit.ScriptModule.save>`_
on the module and pass it a filename::

  traced_script_module.save("traced_resnet_model.pt")

This will produce a ``traced_resnet_model.pt`` file in your working directory.
If you also would like to serialize ``sm``, call ``sm.save("my_module_model.pt")``
We have now officially left the realm of Python and are ready to cross over to the sphere
of C++.

Step 3: Loading Your Script Module in C++
------------------------------------------

To load your serialized PyTorch model in C++, your application must depend on
the PyTorch C++ API -- also known as *LibTorch*. The LibTorch distribution
encompasses a collection of shared libraries, header files and CMake build
configuration files. While CMake is not a requirement for depending on
LibTorch, it is the recommended approach and will be well supported into the
future. For this tutorial, we will be building a minimal C++ application using
CMake and LibTorch that simply loads and executes a serialized PyTorch model.

A Minimal C++ Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's begin by discussing the code to load a module. The following will already
do:

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <torch/script.h> // One-stop header.

    #include <iostream>
    #include <memory>

    int main(int argc, const char* argv[]) {
      if (argc != 2) {
        std::cerr << "usage: example-app <path-to-exported-script-module>\n";
        return -1;
      }


      torch::jit::script::Module module;
      try {
        // Deserialize the ScriptModule from a file using torch::jit::load().
        module = torch::jit::load(argv[1]);
      }
      catch (const c10::Error& e) {
        std::cerr << "error loading the model\n";
        return -1;
      }

      std::cout << "ok\n";
    }


The ``<torch/script.h>`` header encompasses all relevant includes from the
LibTorch library necessary to run the example. Our application accepts the file
path to a serialized PyTorch ``ScriptModule`` as its only command line argument
and then proceeds to deserialize the module using the ``torch::jit::load()``
function, which takes this file path as input. In return we receive a ``torch::jit::script::Module``
object. We will examine how to execute it in a moment.

Depending on LibTorch and Building the Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assume we stored the above code into a file called ``example-app.cpp``. A
minimal ``CMakeLists.txt`` to build it could look as simple as:

.. code-block:: cmake

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0 FATAL_ERROR)
  project(custom_ops)

  find_package(Torch REQUIRED)

  add_executable(example-app example-app.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(example-app "${TORCH_LIBRARIES}")
  set_property(TARGET example-app PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 17)

The last thing we need to build the example application is the LibTorch
distribution. You can always grab the latest stable release from the `download
page <https://pytorch.org/>`_ on the PyTorch website. If you download and unzip
the latest archive, you should receive a folder with the following directory
structure:

.. code-block:: sh

  libtorch/
    bin/
    include/
    lib/
    share/

- The ``lib/`` folder contains the shared libraries you must link against,
- The ``include/`` folder contains header files your program will need to include,
- The ``share/`` folder contains the necessary CMake configuration to enable the simple ``find_package(Torch)`` command above.

.. tip::
  On Windows, debug and release builds are not ABI-compatible. If you plan to
  build your project in debug mode, please try the debug version of LibTorch.
  Also, make sure you specify the correct configuration in the ``cmake --build .``
  line below.

The last step is building the application. For this, assume our example
directory is laid out like this:

.. code-block:: sh

  example-app/
    CMakeLists.txt
    example-app.cpp

We can now run the following commands to build the application from within the
``example-app/`` folder:

.. code-block:: sh

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/libtorch ..
  cmake --build . --config Release

where ``/path/to/libtorch`` should be the full path to the unzipped LibTorch
distribution. If all goes well, it will look something like this:

.. code-block:: sh

  root@4b5a67132e81:/example-app# mkdir build
  root@4b5a67132e81:/example-app# cd build
  root@4b5a67132e81:/example-app/build# cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/libtorch ..

  [100%] Built target example-app

If we supply the path to the traced ``ResNet18`` model ``traced_resnet_model.pt``  we created earlier
to the resulting ``example-app`` binary, we should be rewarded with a friendly
"ok". Please note, if try to run this example with ``my_module_model.pt`` you will get an error saying that
your input is of an incompatible shape. ``my_module_model.pt`` expects 1D instead of 4D.

.. code-block:: sh

  root@4b5a67132e81:/example-app/build# ./example-app <path_to_model>/traced_resnet_model.pt
  ok

Step 4: Executing the Script Module in C++
------------------------------------------

Having successfully loaded our serialized ``ResNet18`` in C++, we are now just a
couple lines of code away from executing it! Let's add those lines to our C++
application's ``main()`` function:

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Create a vector of inputs.
    std::vector<torch::jit::IValue> inputs;
    inputs.push_back(torch::ones({1, 3, 224, 224}));

    // Execute the model and turn its output into a tensor.
    at::Tensor output = module.forward(inputs).toTensor();
    std::cout << output.slice(/*dim=*/1, /*start=*/0, /*end=*/5) << '\n';

The first two lines set up the inputs to our model. We create a vector of
``torch::jit::IValue`` (a type-erased value type ``script::Module`` methods
accept and return) and add a single input. To create the input tensor, we use
``torch::ones()``, the equivalent to ``torch.ones`` in the C++ API.  We then
run the ``script::Module``'s ``forward`` method, passing it the input vector we
created. In return we get a new ``IValue``, which we convert to a tensor by
calling ``toTensor()``.

.. tip::

  To learn more about functions like ``torch::ones`` and the PyTorch C++ API in
  general, refer to its documentation at https://pytorch.org/cppdocs. The
  PyTorch C++ API provides near feature parity with the Python API, allowing
  you to further manipulate and process tensors just like in Python.

In the last line, we print the first five entries of the output. Since we
supplied the same input to our model in Python earlier in this tutorial, we
should ideally see the same output. Let's try it out by re-compiling our
application and running it with the same serialized model:

.. code-block:: sh

  root@4b5a67132e81:/example-app/build# make
  Scanning dependencies of target example-app
  [ 50%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/example-app.dir/example-app.cpp.o
  [100%] Linking CXX executable example-app
  [100%] Built target example-app
  root@4b5a67132e81:/example-app/build# ./example-app traced_resnet_model.pt
  -0.2698 -0.0381  0.4023 -0.3010 -0.0448
  [ Variable[CPUFloatType]{1,5} ]


For reference, the output in Python previously was::

  tensor([-0.2698, -0.0381,  0.4023, -0.3010, -0.0448], grad_fn=<SliceBackward>)

Looks like a good match!

.. tip::

  To move your model to GPU memory, you can write ``model.to(at::kCUDA);``.
  Make sure the inputs to a model are also living in CUDA memory
  by calling ``tensor.to(at::kCUDA)``, which will return a new tensor in CUDA
  memory.

Step 5: Getting Help and Exploring the API
------------------------------------------

This tutorial has hopefully equipped you with a general understanding of a
PyTorch model's path from Python to C++. With the concepts described in this
tutorial, you should be able to go from a vanilla, "eager" PyTorch model, to a
compiled ``ScriptModule`` in Python, to a serialized file on disk and -- to
close the loop -- to an executable ``script::Module`` in C++.

Of course, there are many concepts we did not cover. For example, you may find
yourself wanting to extend your ``ScriptModule`` with a custom operator
implemented in C++ or CUDA, and executing this custom operator inside your
``ScriptModule`` loaded in your pure C++ production environment. The good news
is: this is possible, and well supported! For now, you can explore `this
<https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/master/test/custom_operator>`_ folder
for examples, and we will follow up with a tutorial shortly. In the time being,

Pendulum: Writing your environment and transforms with TorchRL
==============================================================

**Author**: `Vincent Moens <https://github.com/vmoens>`_

Creating an environment (a simulator or an interface to a physical control system)
is an integrative part of reinforcement learning and control engineering.

TorchRL provides a set of tools to do this in multiple contexts.
This tutorial demonstrates how to use PyTorch and TorchRL code a pendulum
simulator from the ground up.
It is freely inspired by the Pendulum-v1 implementation from `OpenAI-Gym/Farama-Gymnasium
control library <https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium>`__.

   Simple Pendulum

Key learnings:

- How to design an environment in TorchRL:
  - Writing specs (input, observation and reward);
  - Implementing behavior: seeding, reset and step.
- Transforming your environment inputs and outputs, and writing your own
  transforms;
- How to use :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict` to carry arbitrary data structures 
  through the ``codebase``.

  In the process, we will touch three crucial components of TorchRL:

* `environments <https://pytorch.org/rl/stable/reference/envs.html>`__
* `transforms <https://pytorch.org/rl/stable/reference/envs.html#transforms>`__
* `models (policy and value function) <https://pytorch.org/rl/stable/reference/modules.html>`__

######################################################################
# To give a sense of what can be achieved with TorchRL's environments, we will
# be designing a *stateless* environment. While stateful environments keep track of
# the latest physical state encountered and rely on this to simulate the state-to-state
# transition, stateless environments expect the current state to be provided to
# them at each step, along with the action undertaken. TorchRL supports both
# types of environments, but stateless environments are more generic and hence
# cover a broader range of features of the environment API in TorchRL.
#
# Modeling stateless environments gives users full control over the input and
# outputs of the simulator: one can reset an experiment at any stage or actively
# modify the dynamics from the outside. However, it assumes that we have some control
# over a task, which may not always be the case: solving a problem where we cannot
# control the current state is more challenging but has a much wider set of applications.
#
# Another advantage of stateless environments is that they can enable
# batched execution of transition simulations. If the backend and the
# implementation allow it, an algebraic operation can be executed seamlessly on
# scalars, vectors, or tensors. This tutorial gives such examples.
#
# This tutorial will be structured as follows:
#
# * We will first get acquainted with the environment properties:
#   its shape (``batch_size``), its methods (mainly :meth:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase.step`,
#   :meth:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase.reset` and :meth:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase.set_seed`)
#   and finally its specs.
# * After having coded our simulator, we will demonstrate how it can be used
#   during training with transforms.
# * We will explore new avenues that follow from the TorchRL's API,
#   including: the possibility of transforming inputs, the vectorized execution
#   of the simulation and the possibility of backpropagation through the
#   simulation graph.
# * Finally, we will train a simple policy to solve the system we implemented.

# There are four things you must take care of when designing a new environment
# class:
#
# * :meth:`EnvBase._reset`, which codes for the resetting of the simulator
#   at a (potentially random) initial state;
# * :meth:`EnvBase._step` which codes for the state transition dynamic;
# * :meth:`EnvBase._set_seed`` which implements the seeding mechanism;
# * the environment specs.
#
# Let us first describe the problem at hand: we would like to model a simple
# pendulum over which we can control the torque applied on its fixed point.
# Our goal is to place the pendulum in upward position (angular position at 0
# by convention) and having it standing still in that position.
# To design our dynamic system, we need to define two equations: the motion
# equation following an action (the torque applied) and the reward equation
# that will constitute our objective function.
#
# For the motion equation, we will update the angular velocity following:
#
# .. math::
#
#    \dot{\theta}_{t+1} = \dot{\theta}_t + (3 * g / (2 * L) * \sin(\theta_t) + 3 / (m * L^2) * u) * dt
#
# where :math:`\dot{\theta}` is the angular velocity in rad/sec, :math:`g` is the
# gravitational force, :math:`L` is the pendulum length, :math:`m` is its mass,
# :math:`\theta` is its angular position and :math:`u` is the torque. The
# angular position is then updated according to
#
# .. math::
#
#    \theta_{t+1} = \theta_{t} + \dot{\theta}_{t+1} dt
#
# We define our reward as
#
# .. math::
#
#    r = -(\theta^2 + 0.1 * \dot{\theta}^2 + 0.001 * u^2)
#
# which will be maximized when the angle is close to 0 (pendulum in upward
# position), the angular velocity is close to 0 (no motion) and the torque is
# 0 too.
#
# Coding the effect of an action: :func:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase._step`
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The step method is the first thing to consider, as it will encode
# the simulation that is of interest to us. In TorchRL, the
# :class:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase` class has a :meth:`EnvBase.step`
# method that receives a :class:`tensordict.TensorDict`
# instance with an ``"action"`` entry indicating what action is to be taken.
#
# To facilitate the reading and writing from that ``tensordict`` and to make sure
# that the keys are consistent with what's expected from the library, the
# simulation part has been delegated to a private abstract method :meth:`_step`
# which reads input data from a ``tensordict``, and writes a *new*  ``tensordict``
# with the output data.
#
# The :func:`_step` method should do the following:
#
#   1. Read the input keys (such as ``"action"``) and execute the simulation
#      based on these;
#   2. Retrieve observations, done state and reward;
#   3. Write the set of observation values along with the reward and done state
#      at the corresponding entries in a new :class:`TensorDict`.
#
# Next, the :meth:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase.step` method will merge the output
# of :meth:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase.step` in the input ``tensordict`` to enforce
# input/output consistency.
#
# Typically, for stateful environments, this will look like this:
#
# .. code-block::
#
#   >>> policy(env.reset())
#   >>> print(tensordict)
#   TensorDict(
#       fields={
#           action: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([1]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.float32, is_shared=False),
#           done: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([1]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.bool, is_shared=False),
#           observation: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.float32, is_shared=False)},
#       batch_size=torch.Size([]),
#       device=cpu,
#       is_shared=False)
#   >>> env.step(tensordict)
#   >>> print(tensordict)
#   TensorDict(
#       fields={
#           action: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([1]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.float32, is_shared=False),
#           done: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([1]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.bool, is_shared=False),
#           next: TensorDict(
#               fields={
#                   done: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([1]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.bool, is_shared=False),
#                   observation: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.float32, is_shared=False),
#                   reward: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([1]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.float32, is_shared=False)},
#               batch_size=torch.Size([]),
#               device=cpu,
#               is_shared=False),
#           observation: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.float32, is_shared=False)},
#       batch_size=torch.Size([]),
#       device=cpu,
#       is_shared=False)
#
# Notice that the root ``tensordict`` has not changed, the only modification is the
# appearance of a new ``"next"`` entry that contains the new information.
#
# In the Pendulum example, our :meth:`_step` method will read the relevant
# entries from the input ``tensordict`` and compute the position and velocity of
# the pendulum after the force encoded by the ``"action"`` key has been applied
# onto it. We compute the new angular position of the pendulum
# ``"new_th"`` as the result of the previous position ``"th"`` plus the new
# velocity ``"new_thdot"`` over a time interval ``dt``.
#
# Since our goal is to turn the pendulum up and maintain it still in that
# position, our ``cost`` (negative reward) function is lower for positions
# close to the target and low speeds.
# Indeed, we want to discourage positions that are far from being "upward"
# and/or speeds that are far from 0.
#
# In our example, :meth:`EnvBase._step` is encoded as a static method since our
# environment is stateless. In stateful settings, the ``self`` argument is
# needed as the state needs to be read from the environment.

# Resetting the simulator: :func:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase._reset`
# -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The second method we need to care about is the
# :meth:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase._reset` method. Like
# :meth:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase._step`, it should write the observation entries
# and possibly a done state in the ``tensordict`` it outputs (if the done state is
# omitted, it will be filled as ``False`` by the parent method
# :meth:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase.reset`). In some contexts, it is required that
# the ``_reset`` method receives a command from the function that called
# it (for example, in multi-agent settings we may want to indicate which agents need
# to be reset). This is why the :meth:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase._reset` method
# also expects a ``tensordict`` as input, albeit it may perfectly be empty or
# ``None``.
#
# The parent :meth:`EnvBase.reset` does some simple checks like the
# :meth:`EnvBase.step` does, such as making sure that a ``"done"`` state
# is returned in the output ``tensordict`` and that the shapes match what is
# expected from the specs.
#
# For us, the only important thing to consider is whether
# :meth:`EnvBase._reset` contains all the expected observations. Once more,
# since we are working with a stateless environment, we pass the configuration
# of the pendulum in a nested ``tensordict`` named ``"params"``.
#
# In this example, we do not pass a done state as this is not mandatory
# for :meth:`_reset` and our environment is non-terminating, so we always
# expect it to be ``False``.
#


def _reset(self, tensordict):
    if tensordict is None or tensordict.is_empty():
        # if no ``tensordict`` is passed, we generate a single set of hyperparameters
        # Otherwise, we assume that the input ``tensordict`` contains all the relevant
        # parameters to get started.

    # for non batch-locked environments, the input ``tensordict`` shape dictates the number
    # of simulators run simultaneously. In other contexts, the initial
    # random state's shape will depend upon the environment batch-size instead.

######################################################################
# Environment metadata: ``env.*_spec``
# ------------------------------------
#
# The specs define the input and output domain of the environment.
# It is important that the specs accurately define the tensors that will be
# received at runtime, as they are often used to carry information about
# environments in multiprocessing and distributed settings. They can also be
# used to instantiate lazily defined neural networks and test scripts without
# actually querying the environment (which can be costly with real-world
# physical systems for instance).
#
# There are four specs that we must code in our environment:
#
# * :obj:`EnvBase.observation_spec`: This will be a :class:`~torchrl.data.CompositeSpec`
#   instance where each key is an observation (a :class:`CompositeSpec` can be
#   viewed as a dictionary of specs).
# * :obj:`EnvBase.action_spec`: It can be any type of spec, but it is required
#   that it corresponds to the ``"action"`` entry in the input ``tensordict``;
# * :obj:`EnvBase.reward_spec`: provides information about the reward space;
# * :obj:`EnvBase.done_spec`: provides information about the space of the done
#   flag.
#
# TorchRL specs are organized in two general containers: ``input_spec`` which
# contains the specs of the information that the step function reads (divided
# between ``action_spec`` containing the action and ``state_spec`` containing
# all the rest), and ``output_spec`` which encodes the specs that the
# step outputs (``observation_spec``, ``reward_spec`` and ``done_spec``).
# In general, you should not interact directly with ``output_spec`` and
# ``input_spec`` but only with their content: ``observation_spec``,
# ``reward_spec``, ``done_spec``, ``action_spec`` and ``state_spec``.
# The reason if that the specs are organized in a non-trivial way
# within ``output_spec`` and
# ``input_spec`` and neither of these should be directly modified.
#
# In other words, the ``observation_spec`` and related properties are
# convenient shortcuts to the content of the output and input spec containers.
#
# TorchRL offers multiple :class:`~torchrl.data.TensorSpec`
# `subclasses <https://pytorch.org/rl/stable/reference/data.html#tensorspec>`_ to
# encode the environment's input and output characteristics.
#
# Specs shape
# ^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# The environment specs leading dimensions must match the
# environment batch-size. This is done to enforce that every component of an
# environment (including its transforms) have an accurate representation of
# the expected input and output shapes. This is something that should be
# accurately coded in stateful settings.
#
# For non batch-locked environments, such as the one in our example (see below),
# this is irrelevant as the environment batch size will most likely be empty.

# Let us try it out:

# Transforming an environment

# This is an ideal scenario to showcase all the features of TorchRL's
# transforms!
#
# For instance, in the following transformed environment we ``unsqueeze`` the entries
# ``["th", "thdot"]`` to be able to stack them along the last
# dimension. We also pass them as ``in_keys_inv`` to squeeze them back to their
# original shape once they are passed as input in the next iteration.

# Writing custom transforms
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# TorchRL's transforms may not cover all the operations one wants to execute
# after an environment has been executed.
# Writing a transform does not require much effort. As for the environment
# design, there are two steps in writing a transform:
#
# - Getting the dynamics right (forward and inverse);
# - Adapting the environment specs.
#
# A transform can be used in two settings: on its own, it can be used as a
# :class:`~torch.nn.Module`. It can also be used appended to a
# :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.TransformedEnv`. The structure of the class allows to
# customize the behavior in the different contexts.
#
# A :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.Transform` skeleton can be summarized as follows:
#
# .. code-block::
#
#   class Transform(nn.Module):
#       def forward(self, tensordict):
#           ...
#       def _apply_transform(self, tensordict):
#           ...
#       def _step(self, tensordict):
#           ...
#       def _call(self, tensordict):
#           ...
#       def inv(self, tensordict):
#           ...
#       def _inv_apply_transform(self, tensordict):
#           ...
#
# There are three entry points (:func:`forward`, :func:`_step` and :func:`inv`)
# which all receive :class:`tensordict.TensorDict` instances. The first two
# will eventually go through the keys indicated by :obj:`~tochrl.envs.transforms.Transform.in_keys`
# and call :meth:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.Transform._apply_transform` to each of these. The results will
# be written in the entries pointed by :obj:`Transform.out_keys` if provided
# (if not the ``in_keys`` will be updated with the transformed values).
# If inverse transforms need to be executed, a similar data flow will be
# executed but with the :func:`Transform.inv` and
# :func:`Transform._inv_apply_transform` methods and across the ``in_keys_inv``
# and ``out_keys_inv`` list of keys.
# The following figure summarized this flow for environments and replay
# buffers.
#
#
#    Transform API
#
# In some cases, a transform will not work on a subset of keys in a unitary
# manner, but will execute some operation on the parent environment or
# work with the entire input ``tensordict``.
# In those cases, the :func:`_call` and :func:`forward` methods should be
# re-written, and the :func:`_apply_transform` method can be skipped.
#
# Let us code new transforms that will compute the ``sine`` and ``cosine``
# values of the position angle, as these values are more useful to us to learn
# a policy than the raw angle value:


class SinTransform(Transform):
    def _apply_transform(self, obs: torch.Tensor) -> None:
        return obs.sin()

    # The transform must also modify the data at reset time
    def _reset(
        self, tensordict: TensorDictBase, tensordict_reset: TensorDictBase
    ) -> TensorDictBase:
        return self._call(tensordict_reset)

    # _apply_to_composite will execute the observation spec transform across all
    # in_keys/out_keys pairs and write the result in the observation_spec which
    # is of type ``Composite``
    @_apply_to_composite
    def transform_observation_spec(self, observation_spec):
        return BoundedTensorSpec(
            low=-1,
            high=1,
            shape=observation_spec.shape,
            dtype=observation_spec.dtype,
            device=observation_spec.device,
        )


class CosTransform(Transform):
    def _apply_transform(self, obs: torch.Tensor) -> None:
        return obs.cos()

    # The transform must also modify the data at reset time
    def _reset(
        self, tensordict: TensorDictBase, tensordict_reset: TensorDictBase
    ) -> TensorDictBase:
        return self._call(tensordict_reset)

    # _apply_to_composite will execute the observation spec transform across all
    # in_keys/out_keys pairs and write the result in the observation_spec which
    # is of type ``Composite``
    @_apply_to_composite
    def transform_observation_spec(self, observation_spec):
        return BoundedTensorSpec(
            low=-1,
            high=1,
            shape=observation_spec.shape,
            dtype=observation_spec.dtype,
            device=observation_spec.device,
        )

# Executing a rollout
# -------------------
#
# Executing a rollout is a succession of simple steps:
#
# * reset the environment
# * while some condition is not met:
#
#   * compute an action given a policy
#   * execute a step given this action
#   * collect the data
#   * make a ``MDP`` step
#
# * gather the data and return
#
# These operations have been conveniently wrapped in the :meth:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase.rollout`
# method, from which we provide a simplified version here below.


def simple_rollout(steps=100):
    # preallocate:
    data = TensorDict({}, [steps])
    # reset
    _data = env.reset()
    for i in range(steps):
        _data["action"] = env.action_spec.rand()
        _data = env.step(_data)
        data[i] = _data
        _data = step_mdp(_data, keep_other=True)
    return data


print("data from rollout:", simple_rollout(100))

######################################################################
# Batching computations
# ---------------------
#
# The last unexplored end of our tutorial is the ability that we have to
# batch computations in TorchRL. Because our environment does not
# make any assumptions regarding the input data shape, we can seamlessly
# execute it over batches of data. Even better: for non-batch-locked
# environments such as our Pendulum, we can change the batch size on the fly
# without recreating the environment.
# To do this, we just generate parameters with the desired shape.
#

batch_size = 10  # number of environments to be executed in batch
td = env.reset(env.gen_params(batch_size=[batch_size]))
print("reset (batch size of 10)", td)
td = env.rand_step(td)
print("rand step (batch size of 10)", td)

######################################################################
# Executing a rollout with a batch of data requires us to reset the environment
# out of the rollout function, since we need to define the batch_size
# dynamically and this is not supported by :meth:`~torchrl.envs.EnvBase.rollout`:
#

rollout = env.rollout(
    3,
    auto_reset=False,  # we're executing the reset out of the ``rollout`` call
    tensordict=env.reset(env.gen_params(batch_size=[batch_size])),
)
print("rollout of len 3 (batch size of 10):", rollout)


######################################################################
# Training a simple policy
# ------------------------
#
# In this example, we will train a simple policy using the reward as a
# differentiable objective, such as a negative loss.
# We will take advantage of the fact that our dynamic system is fully
# differentiable to backpropagate through the trajectory return and adjust the
# weights of our policy to maximize this value directly. Of course, in many
# settings many of the assumptions we make do not hold, such as
# differentiable system and full access to the underlying mechanics.
#
# Still, this is a very simple example that showcases how a training loop can
# be coded with a custom environment in TorchRL.
#
# Let us first write the policy network:
#
torch.manual_seed(0)
env.set_seed(0)

    nn.LazyLinear(64),

######################################################################
# Training loop
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# We will successively:
#
# * generate a trajectory
# * sum the rewards
# * backpropagate through the graph defined by these operations
# * clip the gradient norm and make an optimization step
# * repeat
#
# At the end of the training loop, we should have a final reward close to 0
# which demonstrates that the pendulum is upward and still as desired.

# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# In this tutorial, we have learned how to code a stateless environment from
# scratch. We touched the subjects of:
#
# * The four essential components that need to be taken care of when coding
#   an environment (``step``, ``reset``, seeding and building specs).
#   We saw how these methods and classes interact with the
#   :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict` class;
# * How to test that an environment is properly coded using
#   :func:`~torchrl.envs.utils.check_env_specs`;
# * How to append transforms in the context of stateless environments and how
#   to write custom transformations;
# * How to train a policy on a fully differentiable simulator.

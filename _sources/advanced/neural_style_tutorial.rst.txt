Neural Transfer Using PyTorch
=============================


**Author**: `Alexis Jacq <https://alexis-jacq.github.io>`_
 
**Edited by**: `Winston Herring <https://github.com/winston6>`_

Introduction
------------

This tutorial explains how to implement the `Neural-Style algorithm <https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576>`__
developed by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge.
Neural-Style, or Neural-Transfer, allows you to take an image and
reproduce it with a new artistic style. The algorithm takes three images,
an input image, a content-image, and a style-image, and changes the input
to resemble the content of the content-image and the artistic style of the style-image.

Underlying Principle
--------------------

The principle is simple: we define two distances, one for the content
(:math:`D_C`) and one for the style (:math:`D_S`). :math:`D_C` measures how different the content
is between two images while :math:`D_S` measures how different the style is
between two images. Then, we take a third image, the input, and
transform it to minimize both its content-distance with the
content-image and its style-distance with the style-image. Now we can
import the necessary packages and begin the neural transfer.

Importing Packages and Selecting a Device
-----------------------------------------
Below is a  list of the packages needed to implement the neural transfer.

-  ``torch``, ``torch.nn``, ``numpy`` (indispensables packages for
   neural networks with PyTorch)
-  ``torch.optim`` (efficient gradient descents)
-  ``PIL``, ``PIL.Image``, ``matplotlib.pyplot`` (load and display
   images)
-  ``torchvision.transforms`` (transform PIL images into tensors)
-  ``torchvision.models`` (train or load pretrained models)
-  ``copy`` (to deep copy the models; system package)

Next, we need to choose which device to run the network on and import the
content and style images. Running the neural transfer algorithm on large
images takes longer and will go much faster when running on a GPU. We can
use ``torch.cuda.is_available()`` to detect if there is a GPU available.
Next, we set the ``torch.device`` for use throughout the tutorial. Also the ``.to(device)``
method is used to move tensors or modules to a desired device.

    device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    torch.set_default_device(device)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 76-96

Loading the Images
------------------

Now we will import the style and content images. The original PIL images have values between 0 and 255, but when
transformed into torch tensors, their values are converted to be between
0 and 1. The images also need to be resized to have the same dimensions.
An important detail to note is that neural networks from the
torch library are trained with tensor values ranging from 0 to 1. If you
try to feed the networks with 0 to 255 tensor images, then the activated
feature maps will be unable to sense the intended content and style.
However, pretrained networks from the Caffe library are trained with 0
to 255 tensor images. 


.. note::
    Here are links to download the images required to run the tutorial:
    `picasso.jpg <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/_static/img/neural-style/picasso.jpg>`__ and
    `dancing.jpg <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/_static/img/neural-style/dancing.jpg>`__.
    Download these two images and add them to a directory
    with name ``images`` in your current working directory.

Now, let's create a function that displays an image by reconverting a 
copy of it to PIL format and displaying the copy using 
``plt.imshow``. We will try displaying the content and style images 
to ensure they were imported correctly.

Loss Functions
--------------
Content Loss
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The content loss is a function that represents a weighted version of the
content distance for an individual layer. The function takes the feature
maps :math:`F_{XL}` of a layer :math:`L` in a network processing input :math:`X` and returns the
weighted content distance :math:`w_{CL}.D_C^L(X,C)` between the image :math:`X` and the
content image :math:`C`. The feature maps of the content image(:math:`F_{CL}`) must be
known by the function in order to calculate the content distance. We
implement this function as a torch module with a constructor that takes
:math:`F_{CL}` as an input. The distance :math:`\|F_{XL} - F_{CL}\|^2` is the mean square error
between the two sets of feature maps, and can be computed using ``nn.MSELoss``.

We will add this content loss module directly after the convolution
layer(s) that are being used to compute the content distance. This way
each time the network is fed an input image the content losses will be
computed at the desired layers and because of auto grad, all the
gradients will be computed. Now, in order to make the content loss layer
transparent we must define a ``forward`` method that computes the content
loss and then returns the layer’s input. The computed loss is saved as a
parameter of the module.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 170-185

.. code-block:: default


    class ContentLoss(nn.Module):

        def __init__(self, target,):
            super(ContentLoss, self).__init__()
            # we 'detach' the target content from the tree used
            # to dynamically compute the gradient: this is a stated value,
            # not a variable. Otherwise the forward method of the criterion
            # will throw an error.
            self.target = target.detach()

        def forward(self, input):
            self.loss = F.mse_loss(input, self.target)
            return input








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 186-192

.. note::
   **Important detail**: although this module is named ``ContentLoss``, it
   is not a true PyTorch Loss function. If you want to define your content
   loss as a PyTorch Loss function, you have to create a PyTorch autograd function 
   to recompute/implement the gradient manually in the ``backward``
   method.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 194-216

Style Loss
~~~~~~~~~~

The style loss module is implemented similarly to the content loss
module. It will act as a transparent layer in a
network that computes the style loss of that layer. In order to
calculate the style loss, we need to compute the gram matrix :math:`G_{XL}`. A gram
matrix is the result of multiplying a given matrix by its transposed
matrix. In this application the given matrix is a reshaped version of
the feature maps :math:`F_{XL}` of a layer :math:`L`. :math:`F_{XL}` is reshaped to form :math:`\hat{F}_{XL}`, a :math:`K`\ x\ :math:`N`
matrix, where :math:`K` is the number of feature maps at layer :math:`L` and :math:`N` is the
length of any vectorized feature map :math:`F_{XL}^k`. For example, the first line
of :math:`\hat{F}_{XL}` corresponds to the first vectorized feature map :math:`F_{XL}^1`.

Finally, the gram matrix must be normalized by dividing each element by
the total number of elements in the matrix. This normalization is to
counteract the fact that :math:`\hat{F}_{XL}` matrices with a large :math:`N` dimension yield
larger values in the Gram matrix. These larger values will cause the
first layers (before pooling layers) to have a larger impact during the
gradient descent. Style features tend to be in the deeper layers of the
network so this normalization step is crucial.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 216-231

.. code-block:: default


    def gram_matrix(input):
        a, b, c, d = input.size()  # a=batch size(=1)
        # b=number of feature maps
        # (c,d)=dimensions of a f. map (N=c*d)

        features = input.view(a * b, c * d)  # resize F_XL into \hat F_XL

        G = torch.mm(features, features.t())  # compute the gram product

        # we 'normalize' the values of the gram matrix
        # by dividing by the number of element in each feature maps.
        return G.div(a * b * c * d)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 232-236

Now the style loss module looks almost exactly like the content loss
module. The style distance is also computed using the mean square
error between :math:`G_{XL}` and :math:`G_{SL}`.

        def forward(self, input):
            G = gram_matrix(input)
            self.loss = F.mse_loss(G, self.target)
            return input

Importing the Model
-------------------

Now we need to import a pretrained neural network. We will use a 19
layer VGG network like the one used in the paper.

PyTorch’s implementation of VGG is a module divided into two child
``Sequential`` modules: ``features`` (containing convolution and pooling layers),
and ``classifier`` (containing fully connected layers). We will use the
``features`` module because we need the output of the individual
convolution layers to measure content and style loss. Some layers have
different behavior during training than evaluation, so we must set the
network to evaluation mode using ``.eval()``.

A ``Sequential`` module contains an ordered list of child modules. For
instance, ``vgg19.features`` contains a sequence (``Conv2d``, ``ReLU``, ``MaxPool2d``,
``Conv2d``, ``ReLU``…) aligned in the right order of depth. We need to add our
content loss and style loss layers immediately after the convolution
layer they are detecting. To do this we must create a new ``Sequential``
module that has content loss and style loss modules correctly inserted.

Gradient Descent
----------------

As Leon Gatys, the author of the algorithm, suggested `here <https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/pytorch-tutorial-for-neural-transfert-of-artistic-style/336/20?u=alexis-jacq>`__, we will use
L-BFGS algorithm to run our gradient descent. Unlike training a network,
we want to train the input image in order to minimize the content/style
losses. We will create a PyTorch L-BFGS optimizer ``optim.LBFGS`` and pass
our image to it as the tensor to optimize.

    def get_input_optimizer(input_img):

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 402-413

Finally, we must define a function that performs the neural transfer. For
each iteration of the networks, it is fed an updated input and computes
new losses. We will run the ``backward`` methods of each loss module to
dynamically compute their gradients. The optimizer requires a “closure”
function, which reevaluates the module and returns the loss.

We still have one final constraint to address. The network may try to
optimize the input with values that exceed the 0 to 1 tensor range for
the image. We can address this by correcting the input values to be
between 0 to 1 each time the network is run.

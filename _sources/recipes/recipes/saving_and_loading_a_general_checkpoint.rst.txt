Saving and loading a general checkpoint in PyTorch
==================================================
Saving and loading a general checkpoint model for inference or 
resuming training can be helpful for picking up where you last left off.
When saving a general checkpoint, you must save more than just the
model’s state_dict. It is important to also save the optimizer’s
state_dict, as this contains buffers and parameters that are updated as
the model trains. Other items that you may want to save are the epoch
you left off on, the latest recorded training loss, external
``torch.nn.Embedding`` layers, and more, based on your own algorithm.

Introduction
------------
To save multiple checkpoints, you must organize them in a dictionary and
use ``torch.save()`` to serialize the dictionary. A common PyTorch
convention is to save these checkpoints using the ``.tar`` file
extension. To load the items, first initialize the model and optimizer,
then load the dictionary locally using torch.load(). From here, you can
easily access the saved items by simply querying the dictionary as you
would expect.

In this recipe, we will explore how to save and load multiple
checkpoints.

Setup
-----
Before we begin, we need to install ``torch`` if it isn’t already
available.

::

   pip install torch

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 41-56

Steps
-----

1. Import all necessary libraries for loading our data
2. Define and initialize the neural network
3. Initialize the optimizer
4. Save the general checkpoint
5. Load the general checkpoint

1. Import necessary libraries for loading our data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For this recipe, we will use ``torch`` and its subsidiaries ``torch.nn``
and ``torch.optim``.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 56-62

.. code-block:: default


    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn
    import torch.optim as optim



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 63-69

2. Define and initialize the neural network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For sake of example, we will create a neural network for training
images. To learn more see the Defining a Neural Network recipe.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 69-93

.. code-block:: default


    class Net(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super(Net, self).__init__()
            self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
            self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
            self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
            self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
            self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
            self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)

        def forward(self, x):
            x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
            x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
            x = x.view(-1, 16 * 5 * 5)
            x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
            x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
            x = self.fc3(x)
            return x

    net = Net()
    print(net)

3. Initialize the optimizer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will use SGD with momentum.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 99-103

.. code-block:: default


    optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 104-109

4. Save the general checkpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Collect all relevant information and build your dictionary.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 109-123

.. code-block:: default


    # Additional information
    EPOCH = 5
    PATH = "model.pt"
    LOSS = 0.4

    torch.save({
                'epoch': EPOCH,
                'model_state_dict': net.state_dict(),
                'optimizer_state_dict': optimizer.state_dict(),
                'loss': LOSS,
                }, PATH)



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 124-130

5. Load the general checkpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remember to first initialize the model and optimizer, then load the
dictionary locally.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 130-145

.. code-block:: default


    model = Net()
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)

    checkpoint = torch.load(PATH, weights_only=True)
    model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
    optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint['optimizer_state_dict'])
    epoch = checkpoint['epoch']
    loss = checkpoint['loss']

    model.eval()
    # - or -
    model.train()



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 146-156

You must call ``model.eval()`` to set dropout and batch normalization
layers to evaluation mode before running inference. Failing to do this
will yield inconsistent inference results.

If you wish to resuming training, call ``model.train()`` to ensure these
layers are in training mode.

Congratulations! You have successfully saved and loaded a general
checkpoint for inference and/or resuming training in PyTorch.

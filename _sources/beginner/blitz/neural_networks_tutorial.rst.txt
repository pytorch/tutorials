Neural Networks
===============

Neural networks can be constructed using the ``torch.nn`` package.

Now that you had a glimpse of ``autograd``, ``nn`` depends on
``autograd`` to define models and differentiate them.
An ``nn.Module`` contains layers, and a method ``forward(input)``\ that
returns the ``output``.

For example, look at this network that classfies digit images:

.. figure:: /_static/img/mnist.png
   :alt: convnet

   convnet

It is a simple feed-forward network. It takes the input, feeds it
through several layers one after the other, and then finally gives the
output.

A typical training procedure for a neural network is as follows:

- Define the neural network that has some learnable parameters (or
  weights)
- Iterate over a dataset of inputs
- Process input through the network
- Compute the loss (how far is the output from being correct)
- Propagate gradients back into the network’s parameters
- Update the weights of the network, typically using a simple update rule:
  ``weight = weight + learning_rate * gradient``

Define the network
------------------

Let’s define this network:



.. code-block:: python

    import torch
    from torch.autograd import Variable
    import torch.nn as nn
    import torch.nn.functional as F


    class Net(nn.Module):

        def __init__(self):
            super(Net, self).__init__()
            # 1 input image channel, 6 output channels, 5x5 square convolution
            # kernel
            self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 6, 5)
            self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
            # an affine operation: y = Wx + b
            self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
            self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
            self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)

        def forward(self, x):
            # Max pooling over a (2, 2) window
            x = F.max_pool2d(F.relu(self.conv1(x)), (2, 2))
            # If the size is a square you can only specify a single number
            x = F.max_pool2d(F.relu(self.conv2(x)), 2)
            x = x.view(-1, self.num_flat_features(x))
            x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
            x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
            x = self.fc3(x)
            return x

        def num_flat_features(self, x):
            size = x.size()[1:]  # all dimensions except the batch dimension
            num_features = 1
            for s in size:
                num_features *= s
            return num_features


    net = Net()
    print(net)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    Net (
      (conv1): Conv2d(1, 6, kernel_size=(5, 5), stride=(1, 1))
      (conv2): Conv2d(6, 16, kernel_size=(5, 5), stride=(1, 1))
      (fc1): Linear (400 -> 120)
      (fc2): Linear (120 -> 84)
      (fc3): Linear (84 -> 10)
    )


You just have to define the ``forward`` function, and the ``backward``
function (where gradients are computed) is automatically defined for you
using ``autograd``.
You can use any of the Tensor operations in the ``forward`` function.

The learnable parameters of a model are returned by ``net.parameters()``



.. code-block:: python


    params = list(net.parameters())
    print(len(params))
    print(params[0].size())  # conv1's .weight





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    10
    torch.Size([6, 1, 5, 5])


The input to the forward is an ``autograd.Variable``, and so is the output.



.. code-block:: python


    input = Variable(torch.randn(1, 1, 32, 32))
    out = net(input)
    print(out)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    Variable containing:
    -0.0042 -0.1754  0.0479  0.0740 -0.0719 -0.1126  0.0614 -0.0104  0.1291 -0.0176
    [torch.FloatTensor of size 1x10]


Zero the gradient buffers of all parameters and backprops with random
gradients:



.. code-block:: python

    net.zero_grad()
    out.backward(torch.randn(1, 10))







.. note::

    ``torch.nn`` only supports mini-batches The entire ``torch.nn``
    package only supports inputs that are a mini-batch of samples, and not
    a single sample.

    For example, ``nn.Conv2d`` will take in a 4D Tensor of
    ``nSamples x nChannels x Height x Width``.

    If you have a single sample, just use ``input.unsqueeze(0)`` to add
    a fake batch dimension.

Before proceeding further, let's recap all the classes you’ve seen so far.

**Recap:**
  -  ``torch.Tensor`` - A *multi-dimensional array*.
  -  ``autograd.Variable`` - *Wraps a Tensor and records the history of
     operations* applied to it. Has the same API as a ``Tensor``, with
     some additions like ``backward()``. Also *holds the gradient*
     w.r.t. the tensor.
  -  ``nn.Module`` - Neural network module. *Convenient way of
     encapsulating parameters*, with helpers for moving them to GPU,
     exporting, loading, etc.
  -  ``nn.Parameter`` - A kind of Variable, that is *automatically
     registered as a parameter when assigned as an attribute to a*
     ``Module``.
  -  ``autograd.Function`` - Implements *forward and backward definitions
     of an autograd operation*. Every ``Variable`` operation, creates at
     least a single ``Function`` node, that connects to functions that
     created a ``Variable`` and *encodes its history**.

**At this point, we covered:**
  -  Defining a neural network
  -  Processing inputs and calling backward.

**Still Left:**
  -  Computing the loss
  -  Updating the weights of the network

Loss Function
-------------
A loss function takes the (output, target) pair of inputs, and computes a
value that estimates how far away the output is from the target.

There are several different
`loss functions <http://pytorch.org/docs/nn.html#loss-functions>`_ under the
nn package .
A simple loss is: ``nn.MSELoss`` which computes the mean-squared error
between the input and the target.

For example:



.. code-block:: python


    output = net(input)
    target = Variable(torch.arange(1, 11))  # a dummy target, for example
    criterion = nn.MSELoss()

    loss = criterion(output, target)
    print(loss)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    Variable containing:
     38.4313
    [torch.FloatTensor of size 1]


Now, if you follow ``loss`` in the backward direction, using it’s
``.grad_fn`` attribute, you will see a graph of computations that looks
like this:

::

    input -> conv2d -> relu -> maxpool2d -> conv2d -> relu -> maxpool2d
          -> view -> linear -> relu -> linear -> relu -> linear
          -> MSELoss
          -> loss

So, when we call ``loss.backward()``, the whole graph is differentiated
w.r.t. the loss, and all Variables in the graph will have their
``.grad`` Variable accumulated with the gradient.

For illustration, let us follow a few steps backward:



.. code-block:: python


    print(loss.grad_fn)  # MSELoss
    print(loss.grad_fn.next_functions[0][0])  # Linear
    print(loss.grad_fn.next_functions[0][0].next_functions[0][0])  # ReLU





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    <torch.nn._functions.thnn.auto.MSELoss object at 0x7f72815a1710>
    <torch.autograd.function.LinearBackward object at 0x7f72815a1618>
    <torch.autograd.function.ThresholdBackward object at 0x7f72815a1520>


Backprop
--------
To backpropogate the error all we have to do is to ``loss.backward()``.
You need to clear the existing gradients though, else gradients will be
accumulated to existing gradients


Now we shall call ``loss.backward()``, and have a look at conv1's bias
gradients before and after the backward.



.. code-block:: python



    net.zero_grad()     # zeroes the gradient buffers of all parameters

    print('conv1.bias.grad before backward')
    print(net.conv1.bias.grad)

    loss.backward()

    print('conv1.bias.grad after backward')
    print(net.conv1.bias.grad)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    conv1.bias.grad before backward
    Variable containing:
     0
     0
     0
     0
     0
     0
    [torch.FloatTensor of size 6]

    conv1.bias.grad after backward
    Variable containing:
    1.00000e-02 *
     -0.0139
      2.6429
     -8.6565
     -4.1235
      4.7980
      7.2278
    [torch.FloatTensor of size 6]


Now, we have seen how to use loss functions.

**Read Later:**

  The neural network package contains various modules and loss functions
  that form the building blocks of deep neural networks. A full list with
  documentation is `here <http://pytorch.org/docs/nn>`_

**The only thing left to learn is:**

  - updating the weights of the network

Update the weights
------------------
The simplest update rule used in practice is the Stochastic Gradient
Descent (SGD):

     ``weight = weight - learning_rate * gradient``

We can implement this using simple python code:

.. code:: python

    learning_rate = 0.01
    for f in net.parameters():
        f.data.sub_(f.grad.data * learning_rate)

However, as you use neural networks, you want to use various different
update rules such as SGD, Nesterov-SGD, Adam, RMSProp, etc.
To enable this, we built a small package: ``torch.optim`` that
implements all these methods. Using it is very simple:



.. code-block:: python


    import torch.optim as optim

    # create your optimizer
    optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.01)

    # in your training loop:
    optimizer.zero_grad()   # zero the gradient buffers
    output = net(input)
    loss = criterion(output, target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()    # Does the update

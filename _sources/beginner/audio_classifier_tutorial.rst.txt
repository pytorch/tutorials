Audio Classifier Tutorial
=========================
**Author**: `Winston Herring <https://github.com/winston6>`_

This tutorial will show you how to correctly format an audio dataset and
then train/test an audio classifier network on the dataset. First, let’s
import the common torch packages as well as ``torchaudio``, ``pandas``,
and ``numpy``. ``torchaudio`` is available `here <https://github.com/pytorch/audio>`_
and can be installed by following the
instructions on the website.




.. code-block:: python


    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn
    import torch.nn.functional as F
    import torch.optim as optim
    from torchvision import datasets, transforms
    from torch.utils.data import Dataset
    import torchaudio
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np








Let’s check if a CUDA GPU is available and select our device. Running
the network on a GPU will greatly decrease the training/testing runtime.




.. code-block:: python


    device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    print(device)

Importing the Dataset
---------------------

We will use the UrbanSound8K dataset to train our network. It is
available for free `here <https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/>`_ and contains
10 audio classes with over 8000 audio samples! Once you have downloaded
the compressed dataset, extract it to your current working directory.
First, we will look at the csv file that provides information about the
individual sound files. ``pandas`` allows us to open the csv file and
use ``.iloc()`` to access the data within it.




.. code-block:: python


    csvData = pd.read_csv('./data/UrbanSound8K/metadata/UrbanSound8K.csv')
    print(csvData.iloc[0, :])

    fsID                         100032
    start                             0
    end                        0.317551

    class                      dog_bark
    Name: 0, dtype: object


The 10 audio classes in the UrbanSound8K dataset are air_conditioner,
car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, enginge_idling,
gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music. Let’s play a couple files
and see what they sound like. The first file is street music and the
second is an air conditioner.




.. code-block:: python


    import IPython.display as ipd
    ipd.Audio('./data/UrbanSound8K/audio/fold1/108041-9-0-5.wav')

    ipd.Audio('./data/UrbanSound8K/audio/fold5/100852-0-0-19.wav')








Formatting the Data
-------------------

Now that we know the format of the csv file entries, we can construct
our dataset. We will create a rapper class for our dataset using
``torch.utils.data.Dataset`` that will handle loading the files and
performing some formatting steps. The UrbanSound8K dataset is separated
into 10 folders. We will use the data from 9 of these folders to train
our network and then use the 10th folder to test the network. The rapper
class will store the file names, labels, and folder numbers of the audio
files in the inputted folder list when initialized. The actual loading
and formatting steps will happen in the access function ``__getitem__``.

In ``__getitem__``, we use ``torchaudio.load()`` to convert the wav
files to tensors. ``torchaudio.load()`` returns a tuple containing the
newly created tensor along with the sampling frequency of the audio file
(44.1kHz for UrbanSound8K). The dataset uses two channels for audio so
we will use ``torchaudio.transforms.DownmixMono()`` to convert the audio
data to one channel. Next, we need to format the audio data. The network
we will make takes an input size of 32,000, while most of the audio
files have well over 100,000 samples. The UrbanSound8K audio is sampled
at 44.1kHz, so 32,000 samples only covers around 700 milliseconds. By
downsampling the audio to aproximately 8kHz, we can represent 4 seconds
with the 32,000 samples. This downsampling is achieved by taking every
fifth sample of the original audio tensor. Not every audio tensor is
long enough to handle the downsampling so these tensors will need to be
padded with zeros. The minimum length that won’t require padding is
160,000 samples.

Define the Network
------------------

For this tutorial we will use a convolutional neural network to process
the raw audio data. Usually more advanced transforms are applied to the
audio data, however CNNs can be used to accurately process the raw data.
The specific architecture is modeled after the M5 network architecture
described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.00087.pdf. An important aspect
of models processing raw audio data is the receptive field of their
first layer’s filters. Our model’s first filter is length 80 so when
processing audio sampled at 8kHz the receptive field is around 10ms.
This size is similar to speech processing applications that often use
receptive fields ranging from 20ms to 40ms.

We will use the same optimization technique used in the paper, an Adam
optimizer with weight decay set to 0.0001. At first, we will train with
a learning rate of 0.01, but we will use a ``scheduler`` to decrease it
to 0.001 during training.




.. code-block:: python


    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr = 0.01, weight_decay = 0.0001)
    scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR(optimizer, step_size = 20, gamma = 0.1)








Training and Testing the Network
--------------------------------

Now let’s define a training function that will feed our training data
into the model and perform the backward pass and optimization steps.




.. code-block:: python


    def train(model, epoch):
        model.train()
        for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            data = data.to(device)
            target = target.to(device)
            data = data.requires_grad_() #set requires_grad to True for training
            output = model(data)
            output = output.permute(1, 0, 2) #original output dimensions are batchSizex1x10
            loss = F.nll_loss(output[0], target) #the loss functions expects a batchSizex10 input
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            if batch_idx % log_interval == 0: #print training stats
                print('Train Epoch: {} [{}/{} ({:.0f}%)]\tLoss: {:.6f}'.format(
                    epoch, batch_idx * len(data), len(train_loader.dataset),
                    100. * batch_idx / len(train_loader), loss))








Now that we have a training function, we need to make one for testing
the networks accuracy. We will set the model to ``eval()`` mode and then
run inference on the test dataset. Calling ``eval()`` sets the training
variable in all modules in the network to false. Certain layers like
batch normalization and dropout layers behave differently during
training so this step is crucial for getting correct results.




.. code-block:: python


    def test(model, epoch):
        model.eval()
        correct = 0
        for data, target in test_loader:
            data = data.to(device)
            target = target.to(device)
            output = model(data)
            output = output.permute(1, 0, 2)
            pred = output.max(2)[1] # get the index of the max log-probability
            correct += pred.eq(target).cpu().sum().item()
        print('\nTest set: Accuracy: {}/{} ({:.0f}%)\n'.format(
            correct, len(test_loader.dataset),
            100. * correct / len(test_loader.dataset)))








Finally, we can train and test the network. We will train the network
for ten epochs then reduce the learn rate and train for ten more epochs.
The network will be tested after each epoch to see how the accuracy
varies during the training.

.. note:: Due to a build issue, we've reduced the number of epochs to 10.
          Run this sample with 40 locally to get the proper values.




.. code-block:: python


    log_interval = 20
    for epoch in range(1, 11):
        if epoch == 31:
            print("First round of training complete. Setting learn rate to 0.001.")
        scheduler.step()
        train(model, epoch)
        test(model, epoch)

Conclusion
----------

If trained on 9 folders, the network should be more than 50% accurate by
the end of the training process. Training on less folders will result in
a lower overall accuracy but may be necessary if long runtimes are a
problem. Greater accuracies can be achieved using deeper CNNs at the
expense of a larger memory footprint.

For more advanced audio applications, such as speech recognition,
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are commonly used. There are also other
data preprocessing methods, such as finding the mel frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCC), that can reduce the size of the dataset.

Multi-GPU Examples
==================

Data Parallelism is when we split the mini-batch of samples into
multiple smaller mini-batches and run the computation for each of the
smaller mini-batches in parallel.

Data Parallelism is implemented using ``torch.nn.DataParallel``.
One can wrap a Module in ``DataParallel`` and it will be parallelized
over multiple GPUs in the batch dimension.


DataParallel

    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn


    class DataParallelModel(nn.Module):

        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.block1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)

            # wrap block2 in DataParallel
            self.block2 = nn.Linear(20, 20)
            self.block2 = nn.DataParallel(self.block2)

            self.block3 = nn.Linear(20, 20)

        def forward(self, x):
            x = self.block1(x)
            x = self.block2(x)
            x = self.block3(x)
            return x

The code does not need to be changed in CPU-mode.

The documentation for DataParallel can be found
`here <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#dataparallel-layers-multi-gpu-distributed>`_.

**Attributes of the wrapped module**

After wrapping a Module with ``DataParallel``, the attributes of the module
(e.g. custom methods) became inaccessible. This is because ``DataParallel``
defines a few new members, and allowing other attributes might lead to 
clashes in their names. For those who still want to access the attributes, 
a workaround is to use a subclass of ``DataParallel`` as below.

.. code-block:: default


    class MyDataParallel(nn.DataParallel):
        def __getattr__(self, name):
            try:
                return super().__getattr__(name)
            except AttributeError:
                return getattr(self.module, name)

**Primitives on which DataParallel is implemented upon:**


In general, pytorch’s `nn.parallel` primitives can be used independently.
We have implemented simple MPI-like primitives:

- replicate: replicate a Module on multiple devices
- scatter: distribute the input in the first-dimension
- gather: gather and concatenate the input in the first-dimension
- parallel\_apply: apply a set of already-distributed inputs to a set of
  already-distributed models.

To give a better clarity, here function ``data_parallel`` composed using
these collectives

.. code-block:: default



    def data_parallel(module, input, device_ids, output_device=None):
        if not device_ids:
            return module(input)

        if output_device is None:
            output_device = device_ids[0]

        replicas = nn.parallel.replicate(module, device_ids)
        inputs = nn.parallel.scatter(input, device_ids)
        replicas = replicas[:len(inputs)]
        outputs = nn.parallel.parallel_apply(replicas, inputs)
        return nn.parallel.gather(outputs, output_device)

Part of the model on CPU and part on the GPU
--------------------------------------------

Let’s look at a small example of implementing a network where part of it
is on the CPU and part on the GPU

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 97-119

.. code-block:: default


    device = torch.device("cuda:0")

    class DistributedModel(nn.Module):

        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__(
                embedding=nn.Embedding(1000, 10),
                rnn=nn.Linear(10, 10).to(device),
            )

        def forward(self, x):
            # Compute embedding on CPU
            x = self.embedding(x)

            # Transfer to GPU
            x = x.to(device)

            # Compute RNN on GPU
            x = self.rnn(x)
            return x

This was a small introduction to PyTorch for former Torch users.
There’s a lot more to learn.

Look at our more comprehensive introductory tutorial which introduces
the ``optim`` package, data loaders etc.: :doc:`/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz`.

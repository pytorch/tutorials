Introduction to TorchScript
===========================

**Authors:** James Reed (jamesreed@fb.com), Michael Suo (suo@fb.com), rev2

.. warning:: TorchScript is no longer in active development.

This tutorial is an introduction to TorchScript, an intermediate
representation of a PyTorch model (subclass of ``nn.Module``) that
can then be run in a high-performance environment such as C++.

In this tutorial we will cover:

1. The basics of model authoring in PyTorch, including:

-  Modules
-  Defining ``forward`` functions
-  Composing modules into a hierarchy of modules

2. Specific methods for converting PyTorch modules to TorchScript, our
   high-performance deployment runtime

-  Tracing an existing module
-  Using scripting to directly compile a module
-  How to compose both approaches
-  Saving and loading TorchScript modules

We hope that after you complete this tutorial, you will proceed to go through
`the follow-on tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html>`_
which will walk you through an example of actually calling a TorchScript
model from C++.

Basics of PyTorch Model Authoring
---------------------------------

Let’s start out by defining a simple ``Module``. A ``Module`` is the
basic unit of composition in PyTorch. It contains:

1. A constructor, which prepares the module for invocation
2. A set of ``Parameters`` and sub-\ ``Modules``. These are initialized
   by the constructor and can be used by the module during invocation.
3. A ``forward`` function. This is the code that is run when the module
   is invoked.

Let’s examine a small example:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 56-71

.. code-block:: default


    class MyCell(torch.nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super(MyCell, self).__init__()

        def forward(self, x, h):
            new_h = torch.tanh(x + h)
            return new_h, new_h

    my_cell = MyCell()
    x = torch.rand(3, 4)
    h = torch.rand(3, 4)
    print(my_cell(x, h))

            [0.6013, 0.6992, 0.2618, 0.6668]]), tensor([[0.8219, 0.8990, 0.6670, 0.8277],

            [0.6013, 0.6992, 0.2618, 0.6668]]))




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 72-89

So we’ve:

1. Created a class that subclasses ``torch.nn.Module``.
2. Defined a constructor. The constructor doesn’t do much, just calls
   the constructor for ``super``.
3. Defined a ``forward`` function, which takes two inputs and returns
   two outputs. The actual contents of the ``forward`` function are not
   really important, but it’s sort of a fake `RNN
   cell <https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/>`__–that
   is–it’s a function that is applied on a loop.

We instantiated the module, and made ``x`` and ``h``, which are just 3x4
matrices of random values. Then we invoked the cell with
``my_cell(x, h)``. This in turn calls our ``forward`` function.

Let’s do something a little more interesting:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 89-104

    class MyCell(torch.nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super(MyCell, self).__init__()

        def forward(self, x, h):
            new_h = torch.tanh(self.linear(x) + h)
            return new_h, new_h

    my_cell = MyCell()
    print(my_cell)
    print(my_cell(x, h))

            [ 0.7818, -0.0506,  0.4039,  0.7967]], grad_fn=<TanhBackward0>))




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 105-129

We’ve redefined our module ``MyCell``, but this time we’ve added a
``self.linear`` attribute, and we invoke ``self.linear`` in the forward
function.

What exactly is happening here? ``torch.nn.Linear`` is a ``Module`` from
the PyTorch standard library. Just like ``MyCell``, it can be invoked
using the call syntax. We are building a hierarchy of ``Module``\ s.

``print`` on a ``Module`` will give a visual representation of the
``Module``\ ’s subclass hierarchy. In our example, we can see our
``Linear`` subclass and its parameters.

By composing ``Module``\ s in this way, we can succinctly and readably
author models with reusable components.

You may have noticed ``grad_fn`` on the outputs. This is a detail of
PyTorch’s method of automatic differentiation, called
`autograd <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html>`__.
In short, this system allows us to compute derivatives through
potentially complex programs. The design allows for a massive amount of
flexibility in model authoring.

Now let’s examine said flexibility:

We’ve once again redefined our ``MyCell`` class, but here we’ve defined
``MyDecisionGate``. This module utilizes **control flow**. Control flow
consists of things like loops and ``if``-statements.

Many frameworks take the approach of computing symbolic derivatives
given a full program representation. However, in PyTorch, we use a
gradient tape. We record operations as they occur, and replay them
backwards in computing derivatives. In this way, the framework does not
have to explicitly define derivatives for all constructs in the
language.

Basics of TorchScript
---------------------

Now let’s take our running example and see how we can apply TorchScript.

In short, TorchScript provides tools to capture the definition of your
model, even in light of the flexible and dynamic nature of PyTorch.
Let’s begin by examining what we call **tracing**.

Tracing ``Modules``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 202-216

We’ve rewinded a bit and taken the second version of our ``MyCell``
class. As before, we’ve instantiated it, but this time, we’ve called
``torch.jit.trace``, passed in the ``Module``, and passed in *example
inputs* the network might see.

What exactly has this done? It has invoked the ``Module``, recorded the
operations that occurred when the ``Module`` was run, and created an
instance of ``torch.jit.ScriptModule`` (of which ``TracedModule`` is an
instance)

TorchScript records its definitions in an Intermediate Representation
(or IR), commonly referred to in Deep learning as a *graph*. We can
examine the graph with the ``.graph`` property:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 216-220

.. code-block:: default


    print(traced_cell.graph)

      return (%14)





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 221-226

However, this is a very low-level representation and most of the
information contained in the graph is not useful for end users. Instead,
we can use the ``.code`` property to give a Python-syntax interpretation
of the code:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 226-230

.. code-block:: default


    print(traced_cell.code)






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    def forward(self,
        x: Tensor,
        h: Tensor) -> Tuple[Tensor, Tensor]:
      linear = self.linear
      _0 = torch.tanh(torch.add((linear).forward(x, ), h))
      return (_0, _0)





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 231-248

So **why** did we do all this? There are several reasons:

1. TorchScript code can be invoked in its own interpreter, which is
   basically a restricted Python interpreter. This interpreter does not
   acquire the Global Interpreter Lock, and so many requests can be
   processed on the same instance simultaneously.
2. This format allows us to save the whole model to disk and load it
   into another environment, such as in a server written in a language
   other than Python
3. TorchScript gives us a representation in which we can do compiler
   optimizations on the code to provide more efficient execution
4. TorchScript allows us to interface with many backend/device runtimes
   that require a broader view of the program than individual operators.

We can see that invoking ``traced_cell`` produces the same results as
the Python module:

    print(traced_cell(x, h))

Using Scripting to Convert Modules
----------------------------------

There’s a reason we used version two of our module, and not the one with
the control-flow-laden submodule. Let’s examine that now:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 260-285

.. code-block:: default


    class MyDecisionGate(torch.nn.Module):
        def forward(self, x):
            if x.sum() > 0:

Looking at the ``.code`` output, we can see that the ``if-else`` branch
is nowhere to be found! Why? Tracing does exactly what we said it would:
run the code, record the operations *that happen* and construct a
``ScriptModule`` that does exactly that. Unfortunately, things like control
flow are erased.

How can we faithfully represent this module in TorchScript? We provide a
**script compiler**, which does direct analysis of your Python source
code to transform it into TorchScript. Let’s convert ``MyDecisionGate``
using the script compiler:

Mixing Scripting and Tracing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some situations call for using tracing rather than scripting (e.g. a
module has many architectural decisions that are made based on constant
Python values that we would like to not appear in TorchScript). In this
case, scripting can be composed with tracing: ``torch.jit.script`` will
inline the code for a traced module, and tracing will inline the code
for a scripted module.

An example of the first case:

            for i in range(xs.size(0)):
                y, h = self.cell(xs[i], h)

        cell = self.cell
        _0 = (cell).forward(torch.select(xs, 0, i), h0, )

        y0, h0 = y1, h1

This way, scripting and tracing can be used when the situation calls for
each of them and used together.

Saving and Loading models
-------------------------

We provide APIs to save and load TorchScript modules to/from disk in an
archive format. This format includes code, parameters, attributes, and
debug information, meaning that the archive is a freestanding
representation of the model that can be loaded in an entirely separate
process. Let’s save and load our wrapped RNN module:

.. code-block:: default


    traced.save('wrapped_rnn.pt')

    loaded = torch.jit.load('wrapped_rnn.pt')

    print(loaded)
    print(loaded.code)






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    RecursiveScriptModule(
      original_name=WrapRNN
      (loop): RecursiveScriptModule(
        original_name=MyRNNLoop
        (cell): RecursiveScriptModule(
          original_name=MyCell
          (dg): RecursiveScriptModule(original_name=MyDecisionGate)
          (linear): RecursiveScriptModule(original_name=Linear)
        )
      )
    )
    def forward(self,
        xs: Tensor) -> Tensor:
      loop = self.loop
      _0, y, = (loop).forward(xs, )
      return torch.relu(y)

As you can see, serialization preserves the module hierarchy and the
code we’ve been examining throughout. The model can also be loaded, for
example, `into
C++ <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html>`__ for
python-free execution.

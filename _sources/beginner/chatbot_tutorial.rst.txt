Chatbot Tutorial
================
**Author:** `Matthew Inkawhich <https://github.com/MatthewInkawhich>`_

In this tutorial, we explore a fun and interesting use-case of recurrent
sequence-to-sequence models. We will train a simple chatbot using movie
scripts from the `Cornell Movie-Dialogs
Corpus <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html>`__.

Conversational models are a hot topic in artificial intelligence
research. Chatbots can be found in a variety of settings, including
customer service applications and online helpdesks. These bots are often
powered by retrieval-based models, which output predefined responses to
questions of certain forms. In a highly restricted domain like a
company’s IT helpdesk, these models may be sufficient, however, they are
not robust enough for more general use-cases. Teaching a machine to
carry out a meaningful conversation with a human in multiple domains is
a research question that is far from solved. Recently, the deep learning
boom has allowed for powerful generative models like Google’s `Neural
Conversational Model <https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869>`__, which marks
a large step towards multi-domain generative conversational models. In
this tutorial, we will implement this kind of model in PyTorch.

Preparations
------------

To start, Download the data ZIP file
`here <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html>`__
and put in a ``data/`` directory under the current directory.

After that, let’s import some necessities.



.. code-block:: default


    from __future__ import absolute_import
    from __future__ import division
    from __future__ import print_function
    from __future__ import unicode_literals

    import torch
    from torch.jit import script, trace
    import torch.nn as nn
    from torch import optim
    import torch.nn.functional as F
    import csv
    import random
    import re
    import os

    from io import open
    import itertools
    import math


    USE_CUDA = torch.cuda.is_available()
    device = torch.device("cuda" if USE_CUDA else "cpu")








Load & Preprocess Data
----------------------

The next step is to reformat our data file and load the data into
structures that we can work with.

The `Cornell Movie-Dialogs
Corpus <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html>`__
is a rich dataset of movie character dialog:

-  220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 pairs of movie
   characters
-  9,035 characters from 617 movies
-  304,713 total utterances

This dataset is large and diverse, and there is a great variation of
language formality, time periods, sentiment, etc. Our hope is that this
diversity makes our model robust to many forms of inputs and queries.

First, we’ll take a look at some lines of our datafile to see the
original format.



.. code-block:: default


    corpus_name = "cornell movie-dialogs corpus"
    corpus = os.path.join("data", corpus_name)

    def printLines(file, n=10):
        with open(file, 'rb') as datafile:
            lines = datafile.readlines()
        for line in lines[:n]:
            print(line)

    printLines(os.path.join(corpus, "movie_lines.txt"))

Create formatted data file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For convenience, we'll create a nicely formatted data file in which each line
contains a tab-separated *query sentence* and a *response sentence* pair.

The following functions facilitate the parsing of the raw
*movie_lines.txt* data file.

-  ``loadLines`` splits each line of the file into a dictionary of
   fields (lineID, characterID, movieID, character, text)
-  ``loadConversations`` groups fields of lines from ``loadLines`` into
   conversations based on *movie_conversations.txt*
-  ``extractSentencePairs`` extracts pairs of sentences from
   conversations



.. code-block:: default


    # Splits each line of the file into a dictionary of fields
    def loadLines(fileName, fields):
        lines = {}
        with open(fileName, 'r', encoding='iso-8859-1') as f:
            for line in f:
                values = line.split(" +++$+++ ")
                # Extract fields
                lineObj = {}
                for i, field in enumerate(fields):
                    lineObj[field] = values[i]
                lines[lineObj['lineID']] = lineObj
        return lines


    # Groups fields of lines from `loadLines` into conversations based on *movie_conversations.txt*
    def loadConversations(fileName, lines, fields):
        conversations = []
        with open(fileName, 'r', encoding='iso-8859-1') as f:
            for line in f:
                values = line.split(" +++$+++ ")
                # Extract fields
                convObj = {}
                for i, field in enumerate(fields):
                    convObj[field] = values[i]
                # Convert string to list (convObj["utteranceIDs"] == "['L598485', 'L598486', ...]")
                utterance_id_pattern = re.compile('L[0-9]+')
                lineIds = utterance_id_pattern.findall(convObj["utteranceIDs"])
                # Reassemble lines
                convObj["lines"] = []
                for lineId in lineIds:
                    convObj["lines"].append(lines[lineId])
                conversations.append(convObj)
        return conversations


    # Extracts pairs of sentences from conversations
    def extractSentencePairs(conversations):
        qa_pairs = []
        for conversation in conversations:
            # Iterate over all the lines of the conversation
            for i in range(len(conversation["lines"]) - 1):  # We ignore the last line (no answer for it)
                inputLine = conversation["lines"][i]["text"].strip()
                targetLine = conversation["lines"][i+1]["text"].strip()
                # Filter wrong samples (if one of the lists is empty)
                if inputLine and targetLine:
                    qa_pairs.append([inputLine, targetLine])
        return qa_pairs








Now we’ll call these functions and create the file. We’ll call it
*formatted_movie_lines.txt*.



.. code-block:: default


    # Define path to new file
    datafile = os.path.join(corpus, "formatted_movie_lines.txt")

    delimiter = '\t'
    # Unescape the delimiter
    delimiter = str(codecs.decode(delimiter, "unicode_escape"))

    # Initialize lines dict, conversations list, and field ids
    lines = {}
    conversations = []
    MOVIE_LINES_FIELDS = ["lineID", "characterID", "movieID", "character", "text"]
    MOVIE_CONVERSATIONS_FIELDS = ["character1ID", "character2ID", "movieID", "utteranceIDs"]

    # Load lines and process conversations
    print("\nProcessing corpus...")
    lines = loadLines(os.path.join(corpus, "movie_lines.txt"), MOVIE_LINES_FIELDS)
    print("\nLoading conversations...")
    conversations = loadConversations(os.path.join(corpus, "movie_conversations.txt"),
                                      lines, MOVIE_CONVERSATIONS_FIELDS)

    # Write new csv file
    print("\nWriting newly formatted file...")
    with open(datafile, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as outputfile:
        writer = csv.writer(outputfile, delimiter=delimiter, lineterminator='\n')
        for pair in extractSentencePairs(conversations):
            writer.writerow(pair)

    # Print a sample of lines
    print("\nSample lines from file:")
    printLines(datafile)

Load and trim data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our next order of business is to create a vocabulary and load
query/response sentence pairs into memory.

Note that we are dealing with sequences of **words**, which do not have
an implicit mapping to a discrete numerical space. Thus, we must create
one by mapping each unique word that we encounter in our dataset to an
index value.

For this we define a ``Voc`` class, which keeps a mapping from words to
indexes, a reverse mapping of indexes to words, a count of each word and
a total word count. The class provides methods for adding a word to the
vocabulary (``addWord``), adding all words in a sentence
(``addSentence``) and trimming infrequently seen words (``trim``). More
on trimming later.



.. code-block:: default


    # Default word tokens
    PAD_token = 0  # Used for padding short sentences
    SOS_token = 1  # Start-of-sentence token
    EOS_token = 2  # End-of-sentence token

    class Voc:
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name
            self.trimmed = False
            self.word2index = {}
            self.word2count = {}
            self.index2word = {PAD_token: "PAD", SOS_token: "SOS", EOS_token: "EOS"}
            self.num_words = 3  # Count SOS, EOS, PAD

        def addSentence(self, sentence):
            for word in sentence.split(' '):
                self.addWord(word)

        def addWord(self, word):
            if word not in self.word2index:
                self.word2index[word] = self.num_words
                self.word2count[word] = 1
                self.index2word[self.num_words] = word
                self.num_words += 1
            else:
                self.word2count[word] += 1

        # Remove words below a certain count threshold
        def trim(self, min_count):
            if self.trimmed:
                return
            self.trimmed = True

            keep_words = []

            for k, v in self.word2count.items():
                if v >= min_count:
                    keep_words.append(k)

            print('keep_words {} / {} = {:.4f}'.format(
                len(keep_words), len(self.word2index), len(keep_words) / len(self.word2index)
            ))

            # Reinitialize dictionaries
            self.word2index = {}
            self.word2count = {}
            self.index2word = {PAD_token: "PAD", SOS_token: "SOS", EOS_token: "EOS"}
            self.num_words = 3 # Count default tokens

            for word in keep_words:
                self.addWord(word)








Now we can assemble our vocabulary and query/response sentence pairs.
Before we are ready to use this data, we must perform some
preprocessing.

First, we must convert the Unicode strings to ASCII using
``unicodeToAscii``. Next, we should convert all letters to lowercase and
trim all non-letter characters except for basic punctuation
(``normalizeString``). Finally, to aid in training convergence, we will
filter out sentences with length greater than the ``MAX_LENGTH``
threshold (``filterPairs``).



.. code-block:: default


    MAX_LENGTH = 10  # Maximum sentence length to consider

    # Turn a Unicode string to plain ASCII, thanks to
    # https://stackoverflow.com/a/518232/2809427
    def unicodeToAscii(s):
        return ''.join(
            c for c in unicodedata.normalize('NFD', s)
            if unicodedata.category(c) != 'Mn'
        )

    # Lowercase, trim, and remove non-letter characters
    def normalizeString(s):
        s = unicodeToAscii(s.lower().strip())
        s = re.sub(r"([.!?])", r" \1", s)
        s = re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z.!?]+", r" ", s)
        s = re.sub(r"\s+", r" ", s).strip()
        return s

    # Read query/response pairs and return a voc object
    def readVocs(datafile, corpus_name):
        print("Reading lines...")
        # Read the file and split into lines
        lines = open(datafile, encoding='utf-8').\
            read().strip().split('\n')
        # Split every line into pairs and normalize
        pairs = [[normalizeString(s) for s in l.split('\t')] for l in lines]
        voc = Voc(corpus_name)
        return voc, pairs

    # Returns True iff both sentences in a pair 'p' are under the MAX_LENGTH threshold
    def filterPair(p):
        # Input sequences need to preserve the last word for EOS token
        return len(p[0].split(' ')) < MAX_LENGTH and len(p[1].split(' ')) < MAX_LENGTH

    # Filter pairs using filterPair condition
    def filterPairs(pairs):
        return [pair for pair in pairs if filterPair(pair)]

    # Using the functions defined above, return a populated voc object and pairs list
    def loadPrepareData(corpus, corpus_name, datafile, save_dir):
        print("Start preparing training data ...")
        voc, pairs = readVocs(datafile, corpus_name)
        print("Read {!s} sentence pairs".format(len(pairs)))
        pairs = filterPairs(pairs)
        print("Trimmed to {!s} sentence pairs".format(len(pairs)))
        print("Counting words...")
        for pair in pairs:
            voc.addSentence(pair[0])
            voc.addSentence(pair[1])
        print("Counted words:", voc.num_words)
        return voc, pairs


    # Load/Assemble voc and pairs
    save_dir = os.path.join("data", "save")
    voc, pairs = loadPrepareData(corpus, corpus_name, datafile, save_dir)
    # Print some pairs to validate
    print("\npairs:")
    for pair in pairs[:10]:
        print(pair)

    ['well no . . .', 'then that s all you had to say .']

    ['but', 'you always been this selfish ?']
    ['do you listen to this crap ?', 'what crap ?']
    ['what good stuff ?', 'the real you .']


Another tactic that is beneficial to achieving faster convergence during
training is trimming rarely used words out of our vocabulary. Decreasing
the feature space will also soften the difficulty of the function that
the model must learn to approximate. We will do this as a two-step
process:

1) Trim words used under ``MIN_COUNT`` threshold using the ``voc.trim``
   function.

2) Filter out pairs with trimmed words.



.. code-block:: default


    MIN_COUNT = 3    # Minimum word count threshold for trimming

    def trimRareWords(voc, pairs, MIN_COUNT):
        # Trim words used under the MIN_COUNT from the voc
        voc.trim(MIN_COUNT)
        # Filter out pairs with trimmed words
        keep_pairs = []
        for pair in pairs:
            input_sentence = pair[0]
            output_sentence = pair[1]
            keep_input = True
            keep_output = True
            # Check input sentence
            for word in input_sentence.split(' '):
                if word not in voc.word2index:

                    keep_output = False
                    break

            # Only keep pairs that do not contain trimmed word(s) in their input or output sentence
            if keep_input and keep_output:
                keep_pairs.append(pair)

        print("Trimmed from {} pairs to {}, {:.4f} of total".format(len(pairs), len(keep_pairs), len(keep_pairs) / len(pairs)))

Prepare Data for Models
-----------------------

Although we have put a great deal of effort into preparing and massaging our
data into a nice vocabulary object and list of sentence pairs, our models
will ultimately expect numerical torch tensors as inputs. One way to
prepare the processed data for the models can be found in the `seq2seq
translation
tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html>`__.
In that tutorial, we use a batch size of 1, meaning that all we have to
do is convert the words in our sentence pairs to their corresponding
indexes from the vocabulary and feed this to the models.

However, if you’re interested in speeding up training and/or would like
to leverage GPU parallelization capabilities, you will need to train
with mini-batches.

Using mini-batches also means that we must be mindful of the variation
of sentence length in our batches. To accommodate sentences of different
sizes in the same batch, we will make our batched input tensor of shape
*(max_length, batch_size)*, where sentences shorter than the
*max_length* are zero padded after an *EOS_token*.

If we simply convert our English sentences to tensors by converting
words to their indexes(\ ``indexesFromSentence``) and zero-pad, our
tensor would have shape *(batch_size, max_length)* and indexing the
first dimension would return a full sequence across all time-steps.
However, we need to be able to index our batch along time, and across
all sequences in the batch. Therefore, we transpose our input batch
shape to *(max_length, batch_size)*, so that indexing across the first
dimension returns a time step across all sentences in the batch. We
handle this transpose implicitly in the ``zeroPadding`` function.

.. figure:: /_static/img/chatbot/seq2seq_batches.png
   :align: center
   :alt: batches

The ``inputVar`` function handles the process of converting sentences to
tensor, ultimately creating a correctly shaped zero-padded tensor. It
also returns a tensor of ``lengths`` for each of the sequences in the
batch which will be passed to our decoder later.

The ``outputVar`` function performs a similar function to ``inputVar``,
but instead of returning a ``lengths`` tensor, it returns a binary mask
tensor and a maximum target sentence length. The binary mask tensor has
the same shape as the output target tensor, but every element that is a
*PAD_token* is 0 and all others are 1.

``batch2TrainData`` simply takes a bunch of pairs and returns the input
and target tensors using the aforementioned functions.



.. code-block:: default


    def indexesFromSentence(voc, sentence):

Define Models
-------------

Seq2Seq Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The brains of our chatbot is a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model. The
goal of a seq2seq model is to take a variable-length sequence as an
input, and return a variable-length sequence as an output using a
fixed-sized model.

`Sutskever et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__ discovered that
by using two separate recurrent neural nets together, we can accomplish
this task. One RNN acts as an **encoder**, which encodes a variable
length input sequence to a fixed-length context vector. In theory, this
context vector (the final hidden layer of the RNN) will contain semantic
information about the query sentence that is input to the bot. The
second RNN is a **decoder**, which takes an input word and the context
vector, and returns a guess for the next word in the sequence and a
hidden state to use in the next iteration.

Encoder
~~~~~~~

The encoder RNN iterates through the input sentence one token
(e.g. word) at a time, at each time step outputting an “output” vector
and a “hidden state” vector. The hidden state vector is then passed to
the next time step, while the output vector is recorded. The encoder
transforms the context it saw at each point in the sequence into a set
of points in a high-dimensional space, which the decoder will use to
generate a meaningful output for the given task.

At the heart of our encoder is a multi-layered Gated Recurrent Unit,
invented by `Cho et al. <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078v3.pdf>`__ in
2014. We will use a bidirectional variant of the GRU, meaning that there
are essentially two independent RNNs: one that is fed the input sequence
in normal sequential order, and one that is fed the input sequence in
reverse order. The outputs of each network are summed at each time step.
Using a bidirectional GRU will give us the advantage of encoding both
past and future contexts.

Bidirectional RNN:

   :alt: rnn_bidir

Image source: https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/

Note that an ``embedding`` layer is used to encode our word indices in
an arbitrarily sized feature space. For our models, this layer will map
each word to a feature space of size *hidden_size*. When trained, these
values should encode semantic similarity between similar meaning words.

Finally, if passing a padded batch of sequences to an RNN module, we
must pack and unpack padding around the RNN pass using
``nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence`` and
``nn.utils.rnn.pad_packed_sequence`` respectively.

**Computation Graph:**

   1) Convert word indexes to embeddings.
   2) Pack padded batch of sequences for RNN module.
   3) Forward pass through GRU.
   4) Unpack padding.
   5) Sum bidirectional GRU outputs.
   6) Return output and final hidden state.

**Inputs:**

-  ``input_seq``: batch of input sentences; shape=\ *(max_length,
   batch_size)*
-  ``input_lengths``: list of sentence lengths corresponding to each
   sentence in the batch; shape=\ *(batch_size)*
-  ``hidden``: hidden state; shape=\ *(n_layers x num_directions,
   batch_size, hidden_size)*

**Outputs:**

-  ``outputs``: output features from the last hidden layer of the GRU
   (sum of bidirectional outputs); shape=\ *(max_length, batch_size,
   hidden_size)*
-  ``hidden``: updated hidden state from GRU; shape=\ *(n_layers x
   num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size)*

    class EncoderRNN(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, hidden_size, embedding, n_layers=1, dropout=0):
            super(EncoderRNN, self).__init__()
            self.n_layers = n_layers
            self.hidden_size = hidden_size
            self.embedding = embedding

            # Initialize GRU; the input_size and hidden_size params are both set to 'hidden_size'
            #   because our input size is a word embedding with number of features == hidden_size
            self.gru = nn.GRU(hidden_size, hidden_size, n_layers,
                              dropout=(0 if n_layers == 1 else dropout), bidirectional=True)

        def forward(self, input_seq, input_lengths, hidden=None):
            # Convert word indexes to embeddings
            embedded = self.embedding(input_seq)
            # Pack padded batch of sequences for RNN module
            packed = nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence(embedded, input_lengths)
            # Forward pass through GRU
            outputs, hidden = self.gru(packed, hidden)
            # Unpack padding
            outputs, _ = nn.utils.rnn.pad_packed_sequence(outputs)
            # Sum bidirectional GRU outputs
            outputs = outputs[:, :, :self.hidden_size] + outputs[:, : ,self.hidden_size:]
            # Return output and final hidden state
            return outputs, hidden








Decoder
~~~~~~~

The decoder RNN generates the response sentence in a token-by-token
fashion. It uses the encoder’s context vectors, and internal hidden
states to generate the next word in the sequence. It continues
generating words until it outputs an *EOS_token*, representing the end
of the sentence. A common problem with a vanilla seq2seq decoder is that
if we rely solely on the context vector to encode the entire input
sequence’s meaning, it is likely that we will have information loss.
This is especially the case when dealing with long input sequences,
greatly limiting the capability of our decoder.

To combat this, `Bahdanau et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`__
created an “attention mechanism” that allows the decoder to pay
attention to certain parts of the input sequence, rather than using the
entire fixed context at every step.

At a high level, attention is calculated using the decoder’s current
hidden state and the encoder’s outputs. The output attention weights
have the same shape as the input sequence, allowing us to multiply them
by the encoder outputs, giving us a weighted sum which indicates the
parts of encoder output to pay attention to. `Sean
Robertson’s <https://github.com/spro>`__ figure describes this very
well:

.. figure:: /_static/img/chatbot/attn2.png
   :align: center
   :alt: attn2

`Luong et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025>`__ improved upon
Bahdanau et al.’s groundwork by creating “Global attention”. The key
difference is that with “Global attention”, we consider all of the
encoder’s hidden states, as opposed to Bahdanau et al.’s “Local
attention”, which only considers the encoder’s hidden state from the
current time step. Another difference is that with “Global attention”,
we calculate attention weights, or energies, using the hidden state of
the decoder from the current time step only. Bahdanau et al.’s attention
calculation requires knowledge of the decoder’s state from the previous
time step. Also, Luong et al. provides various methods to calculate the
attention energies between the encoder output and decoder output which
are called “score functions”:

.. figure:: /_static/img/chatbot/scores.png
   :width: 60%
   :align: center
   :alt: scores

where :math:`h_t` = current target decoder state and :math:`\bar{h}_s` =
all encoder states.

Overall, the Global attention mechanism can be summarized by the
following figure. Note that we will implement the “Attention Layer” as a
separate ``nn.Module`` called ``Attn``. The output of this module is a
softmax normalized weights tensor of shape *(batch_size, 1,
max_length)*.

    # Luong attention layer
    class Attn(nn.Module):

            super(Attn, self).__init__()
            self.method = method
            if self.method not in ['dot', 'general', 'concat']:
                raise ValueError(self.method, "is not an appropriate attention method.")
            self.hidden_size = hidden_size
            if self.method == 'general':
                self.attn = nn.Linear(self.hidden_size, hidden_size)
            elif self.method == 'concat':
                self.attn = nn.Linear(self.hidden_size * 2, hidden_size)

            return torch.sum(hidden * energy, dim=2)

        def concat_score(self, hidden, encoder_output):
            energy = self.attn(torch.cat((hidden.expand(encoder_output.size(0), -1, -1), encoder_output), 2)).tanh()
            return torch.sum(self.v * energy, dim=2)

        def forward(self, hidden, encoder_outputs):
            # Calculate the attention weights (energies) based on the given method
            if self.method == 'general':
                attn_energies = self.general_score(hidden, encoder_outputs)
            elif self.method == 'concat':
                attn_energies = self.concat_score(hidden, encoder_outputs)
            elif self.method == 'dot':
                attn_energies = self.dot_score(hidden, encoder_outputs)

            # Transpose max_length and batch_size dimensions
            attn_energies = attn_energies.t()

            # Return the softmax normalized probability scores (with added dimension)
            return F.softmax(attn_energies, dim=1).unsqueeze(1)








Now that we have defined our attention submodule, we can implement the
actual decoder model. For the decoder, we will manually feed our batch
one time step at a time. This means that our embedded word tensor and
GRU output will both have shape *(1, batch_size, hidden_size)*.

**Computation Graph:**

   1) Get embedding of current input word.
   2) Forward through unidirectional GRU.
   3) Calculate attention weights from the current GRU output from (2).
   4) Multiply attention weights to encoder outputs to get new "weighted sum" context vector.
   5) Concatenate weighted context vector and GRU output using Luong eq. 5.
   6) Predict next word using Luong eq. 6 (without softmax).
   7) Return output and final hidden state.

**Inputs:**

-  ``input_step``: one time step (one word) of input sequence batch;
   shape=\ *(1, batch_size)*
-  ``last_hidden``: final hidden layer of GRU; shape=\ *(n_layers x
   num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size)*
-  ``encoder_outputs``: encoder model’s output; shape=\ *(max_length,
   batch_size, hidden_size)*

**Outputs:**

-  ``output``: softmax normalized tensor giving probabilities of each
   word being the correct next word in the decoded sequence;
   shape=\ *(batch_size, voc.num_words)*
-  ``hidden``: final hidden state of GRU; shape=\ *(n_layers x
   num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size)*

Define Training Procedure
-------------------------

Masked loss
~~~~~~~~~~~

Since we are dealing with batches of padded sequences, we cannot simply
consider all elements of the tensor when calculating loss. We define
``maskNLLLoss`` to calculate our loss based on our decoder’s output
tensor, the target tensor, and a binary mask tensor describing the
padding of the target tensor. This loss function calculates the average
negative log likelihood of the elements that correspond to a *1* in the
mask tensor.



.. code-block:: default


    def maskNLLLoss(inp, target, mask):
        nTotal = mask.sum()
        crossEntropy = -torch.log(torch.gather(inp, 1, target.view(-1, 1)).squeeze(1))
        loss = crossEntropy.masked_select(mask).mean()
        loss = loss.to(device)
        return loss, nTotal.item()








Single training iteration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``train`` function contains the algorithm for a single training
iteration (a single batch of inputs).

We will use a couple of clever tricks to aid in convergence:

-  The first trick is using **teacher forcing**. This means that at some
   probability, set by ``teacher_forcing_ratio``, we use the current
   target word as the decoder’s next input rather than using the
   decoder’s current guess. This technique acts as training wheels for
   the decoder, aiding in more efficient training. However, teacher
   forcing can lead to model instability during inference, as the
   decoder may not have a sufficient chance to truly craft its own
   output sequences during training. Thus, we must be mindful of how we
   are setting the ``teacher_forcing_ratio``, and not be fooled by fast
   convergence.

-  The second trick that we implement is **gradient clipping**. This is
   a commonly used technique for countering the “exploding gradient”
   problem. In essence, by clipping or thresholding gradients to a
   maximum value, we prevent the gradients from growing exponentially
   and either overflow (NaN), or overshoot steep cliffs in the cost
   function.

   :width: 60%
   :alt: grad_clip

**Sequence of Operations:**

   1) Forward pass entire input batch through encoder.
   2) Initialize decoder inputs as SOS_token, and hidden state as the encoder's final hidden state.
   3) Forward input batch sequence through decoder one time step at a time.
   4) If teacher forcing: set next decoder input as the current target; else: set next decoder input as current decoder output.
   5) Calculate and accumulate loss.
   6) Perform backpropagation.
   7) Clip gradients.
   8) Update encoder and decoder model parameters.


.. Note ::

  PyTorch’s RNN modules (``RNN``, ``LSTM``, ``GRU``) can be used like any
  other non-recurrent layers by simply passing them the entire input
  sequence (or batch of sequences). We use the ``GRU`` layer like this in
  the ``encoder``. The reality is that under the hood, there is an
  iterative process looping over each time step calculating hidden states.
  Alternatively, you can run these modules one time-step at a time. In
  this case, we manually loop over the sequences during the training
  process like we must do for the ``decoder`` model. As long as you
  maintain the correct conceptual model of these modules, implementing
  sequential models can be very straightforward.

Training iterations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is finally time to tie the full training procedure together with the
data. The ``trainIters`` function is responsible for running
``n_iterations`` of training given the passed models, optimizers, data,
etc. This function is quite self explanatory, as we have done the heavy
lifting with the ``train`` function.

One thing to note is that when we save our model, we save a tarball
containing the encoder and decoder state_dicts (parameters), the
optimizers’ state_dicts, the loss, the iteration, etc. Saving the model
in this way will give us the ultimate flexibility with the checkpoint.
After loading a checkpoint, we will be able to use the model parameters
to run inference, or we can continue training right where we left off.

Define Evaluation
-----------------

After training a model, we want to be able to talk to the bot ourselves.
First, we must define how we want the model to decode the encoded input.

Greedy decoding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Greedy decoding is the decoding method that we use during training when
we are **NOT** using teacher forcing. In other words, for each time
step, we simply choose the word from ``decoder_output`` with the highest
softmax value. This decoding method is optimal on a single time-step
level.

To facilitate the greedy decoding operation, we define a
``GreedySearchDecoder`` class. When run, an object of this class takes
an input sequence (``input_seq``) of shape *(input_seq length, 1)*, a
scalar input length (``input_length``) tensor, and a ``max_length`` to
bound the response sentence length. The input sentence is evaluated
using the following computational graph:

**Computation Graph:**

   1) Forward input through encoder model.
   2) Prepare encoder's final hidden layer to be first hidden input to the decoder.
   3) Initialize decoder's first input as SOS_token.
   4) Initialize tensors to append decoded words to.
   5) Iteratively decode one word token at a time:
       a) Forward pass through decoder.
       b) Obtain most likely word token and its softmax score.
       c) Record token and score.
       d) Prepare current token to be next decoder input.
   6) Return collections of word tokens and scores.



.. code-block:: default


    class GreedySearchDecoder(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, encoder, decoder):
            super(GreedySearchDecoder, self).__init__()
            self.encoder = encoder
            self.decoder = decoder

        def forward(self, input_seq, input_length, max_length):
            # Forward input through encoder model
            encoder_outputs, encoder_hidden = self.encoder(input_seq, input_length)
            # Prepare encoder's final hidden layer to be first hidden input to the decoder
            decoder_hidden = encoder_hidden[:decoder.n_layers]
            # Initialize decoder input with SOS_token
            decoder_input = torch.ones(1, 1, device=device, dtype=torch.long) * SOS_token
            # Initialize tensors to append decoded words to
            all_tokens = torch.zeros([0], device=device, dtype=torch.long)
            all_scores = torch.zeros([0], device=device)
            # Iteratively decode one word token at a time
            for _ in range(max_length):
                # Forward pass through decoder
                decoder_output, decoder_hidden = self.decoder(decoder_input, decoder_hidden, encoder_outputs)
                # Obtain most likely word token and its softmax score
                decoder_scores, decoder_input = torch.max(decoder_output, dim=1)
                # Record token and score
                all_tokens = torch.cat((all_tokens, decoder_input), dim=0)
                all_scores = torch.cat((all_scores, decoder_scores), dim=0)
                # Prepare current token to be next decoder input (add a dimension)
                decoder_input = torch.unsqueeze(decoder_input, 0)
            # Return collections of word tokens and scores
            return all_tokens, all_scores








Evaluate my text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we have our decoding method defined, we can write functions for
evaluating a string input sentence. The ``evaluate`` function manages
the low-level process of handling the input sentence. We first format
the sentence as an input batch of word indexes with *batch_size==1*. We
do this by converting the words of the sentence to their corresponding
indexes, and transposing the dimensions to prepare the tensor for our
models. We also create a ``lengths`` tensor which contains the length of
our input sentence. In this case, ``lengths`` is scalar because we are
only evaluating one sentence at a time (batch_size==1). Next, we obtain
the decoded response sentence tensor using our ``GreedySearchDecoder``
object (``searcher``). Finally, we convert the response’s indexes to
words and return the list of decoded words.

``evaluateInput`` acts as the user interface for our chatbot. When
called, an input text field will spawn in which we can enter our query
sentence. After typing our input sentence and pressing *Enter*, our text
is normalized in the same way as our training data, and is ultimately
fed to the ``evaluate`` function to obtain a decoded output sentence. We
loop this process, so we can keep chatting with our bot until we enter
either “q” or “quit”.

Finally, if a sentence is entered that contains a word that is not in
the vocabulary, we handle this gracefully by printing an error message
and prompting the user to enter another sentence.



.. code-block:: default


    def evaluate(encoder, decoder, searcher, voc, sentence, max_length=MAX_LENGTH):
        ### Format input sentence as a batch
        # words -> indexes
        indexes_batch = [indexesFromSentence(voc, sentence)]
        # Create lengths tensor
        lengths = torch.tensor([len(indexes) for indexes in indexes_batch])
        # Transpose dimensions of batch to match models' expectations
        input_batch = torch.LongTensor(indexes_batch).transpose(0, 1)
        # Use appropriate device
        input_batch = input_batch.to(device)
        lengths = lengths.to("cpu")
        # Decode sentence with searcher
        tokens, scores = searcher(input_batch, lengths, max_length)
        # indexes -> words
        decoded_words = [voc.index2word[token.item()] for token in tokens]
        return decoded_words


    def evaluateInput(encoder, decoder, searcher, voc):
        input_sentence = ''
        while(1):
            try:
                # Get input sentence
                input_sentence = input('> ')
                # Check if it is quit case
                if input_sentence == 'q' or input_sentence == 'quit': break
                # Normalize sentence
                input_sentence = normalizeString(input_sentence)
                # Evaluate sentence
                output_words = evaluate(encoder, decoder, searcher, voc, input_sentence)
                # Format and print response sentence
                output_words[:] = [x for x in output_words if not (x == 'EOS' or x == 'PAD')]
                print('Bot:', ' '.join(output_words))

            except KeyError:
                print("Error: Encountered unknown word.")








Run Model
---------

Finally, it is time to run our model!

Regardless of whether we want to train or test the chatbot model, we
must initialize the individual encoder and decoder models. In the
following block, we set our desired configurations, choose to start from
scratch or set a checkpoint to load from, and build and initialize the
models. Feel free to play with different model configurations to
optimize performance.

Run Evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To chat with your model, run the following block.



.. code-block:: default


    # Set dropout layers to eval mode
    encoder.eval()
    decoder.eval()

    # Initialize search module
    searcher = GreedySearchDecoder(encoder, decoder)

    # Begin chatting (uncomment and run the following line to begin)
    # evaluateInput(encoder, decoder, searcher, voc)








Conclusion
----------

That’s all for this one, folks. Congratulations, you now know the
fundamentals to building a generative chatbot model! If you’re
interested, you can try tailoring the chatbot’s behavior by tweaking the
model and training parameters and customizing the data that you train
the model on.

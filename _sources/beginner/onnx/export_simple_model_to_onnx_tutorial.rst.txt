Export a PyTorch model to ONNX
==============================

.. note::
    As of PyTorch 2.5, there are two versions of ONNX Exporter.

    * ``torch.onnx.export(..., dynamo=True)`` is the newest (still in beta) exporter using ``torch.export`` and Torch FX to capture the graph. It was released with PyTorch 2.5
    * ``torch.onnx.export`` uses TorchScript and has been available since PyTorch 1.2.0

In the `60 Minute Blitz <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html>`_,
we had the opportunity to learn about PyTorch at a high level and train a small neural network to classify images.
In this tutorial, we are going to expand this to describe how to convert a model defined in PyTorch into the
ONNX format using the ``torch.onnx.export(..., dynamo=True)`` ONNX exporter.

While PyTorch is great for iterating on the development of models, the model can be deployed to production
using different formats, including `ONNX <https://onnx.ai/>`_ (Open Neural Network Exchange)!

ONNX is a flexible open standard format for representing machine learning models which standardized representations
of machine learning allow them to be executed across a gamut of hardware platforms and runtime environments
from large-scale cloud-based supercomputers to resource-constrained edge devices, such as your web browser and phone.

In this tutorial, we’ll learn how to:

1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Author a simple image classifier model.
3. Export the model to ONNX format.
4. Save the ONNX model in a file.
5. Visualize the ONNX model graph using `Netron <https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron>`_.
6. Execute the ONNX model with `ONNX Runtime`
7. Compare the PyTorch results with the ones from the ONNX Runtime.

1. Install the required dependencies
------------------------------------
Because the ONNX exporter uses ``onnx`` and ``onnxscript`` to translate PyTorch operators into ONNX operators,
we will need to install them.

 .. code-block:: bash

  pip install --upgrade onnx onnxscript

2. Author a simple image classifier model
-----------------------------------------

Once your environment is set up, let’s start modeling our image classifier with PyTorch,
exactly like we did in the `60 Minute Blitz <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html>`_.

            return x

3. Export the model to ONNX format
----------------------------------

Now that we have our model defined, we need to instantiate it and create a random 32x32 input.
Next, we can export the model to ONNX format.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 90-96

.. code-block:: default


    torch_model = ImageClassifierModel()
    # Create example inputs for exporting the model. The inputs should be a tuple of tensors.
    example_inputs = (torch.randn(1, 1, 32, 32),)
    onnx_program = torch.onnx.export(torch_model, example_inputs, dynamo=True)

3.5. (Optional) Optimize the ONNX model
---------------------------------------

The ONNX model can be optimized with constant folding, and elimination of redundant nodes.
The optimization is done in-place, so the original ONNX model is modified.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 102-105

.. code-block:: default


    onnx_program.optimize()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 106-114

As we can see, we didn't need any code change to the model.
The resulting ONNX model is stored within ``torch.onnx.ONNXProgram`` as a binary protobuf file.

4. Save the ONNX model in a file
--------------------------------

Although having the exported model loaded in memory is useful in many applications,
we can save it to disk with the following code:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 114-117

.. code-block:: default


    onnx_program.save("image_classifier_model.onnx")








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 118-119

You can load the ONNX file back into memory and check if it is well formed with the following code:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 119-125

.. code-block:: default


    import onnx

    onnx_model = onnx.load("image_classifier_model.onnx")
    onnx.checker.check_model(onnx_model)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 126-166

5. Visualize the ONNX model graph using Netron
----------------------------------------------

Now that we have our model saved in a file, we can visualize it with `Netron <https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron>`_.
Netron can either be installed on macos, Linux or Windows computers, or run directly from the browser.
Let's try the web version by opening the following link: https://netron.app/.

.. image:: ../../_static/img/onnx/netron_web_ui.png
  :width: 70%
  :align: center


Once Netron is open, we can drag and drop our ``image_classifier_model.onnx`` file into the browser or select it after
clicking the **Open model** button.

.. image:: ../../_static/img/onnx/image_classifier_onnx_model_on_netron_web_ui.png
  :width: 50%


And that is it! We have successfully exported our PyTorch model to ONNX format and visualized it with Netron.

6. Execute the ONNX model with ONNX Runtime
-------------------------------------------

The last step is executing the ONNX model with `ONNX Runtime`, but before we do that, let's install ONNX Runtime.

 .. code-block:: bash

  pip install onnxruntime

The ONNX standard does not support all the data structure and types that PyTorch does,
so we need to adapt PyTorch input's to ONNX format before feeding it to ONNX Runtime.
In our example, the input happens to be the same, but it might have more inputs
than the original PyTorch model in more complex models.

ONNX Runtime requires an additional step that involves converting all PyTorch tensors to Numpy (in CPU)
and wrap them on a dictionary with keys being a string with the input name as key and the numpy tensor as the value.

Now we can create an *ONNX Runtime Inference Session*, execute the ONNX model with the processed input
and get the output. In this tutorial, ONNX Runtime is executed on CPU, but it could be executed on GPU as well.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 166-182

.. code-block:: default


    import onnxruntime

    onnx_inputs = [tensor.numpy(force=True) for tensor in example_inputs]
    print(f"Input length: {len(onnx_inputs)}")
    print(f"Sample input: {onnx_inputs}")

    ort_session = onnxruntime.InferenceSession(
        "./image_classifier_model.onnx", providers=["CPUExecutionProvider"]
    )

    onnxruntime_input = {input_arg.name: input_value for input_arg, input_value in zip(ort_session.get_inputs(), onnx_inputs)}

    # ONNX Runtime returns a list of outputs
    onnxruntime_outputs = ort_session.run(None, onnxruntime_input)[0]

7. Compare the PyTorch results with the ones from the ONNX Runtime
------------------------------------------------------------------

The best way to determine whether the exported model is looking good is through numerical evaluation
against PyTorch, which is our source of truth.

For that, we need to execute the PyTorch model with the same input and compare the results with ONNX Runtime's.
Before comparing the results, we need to convert the PyTorch's output to match ONNX's format.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 191-202

.. code-block:: default


    torch_outputs = torch_model(*example_inputs)

    assert len(torch_outputs) == len(onnxruntime_outputs)
    for torch_output, onnxruntime_output in zip(torch_outputs, onnxruntime_outputs):
        torch.testing.assert_close(torch_output, torch.tensor(onnxruntime_output))

    print("PyTorch and ONNX Runtime output matched!")
    print(f"Output length: {len(onnxruntime_outputs)}")
    print(f"Sample output: {onnxruntime_outputs}")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

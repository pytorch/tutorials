PyTorch: nn
-----------

A third order polynomial, trained to predict :math:`y=\sin(x)` from :math:`-\pi`
to :math:`pi` by minimizing squared Euclidean distance.

This implementation uses the nn package from PyTorch to build the network.
PyTorch autograd makes it easy to define computational graphs and take gradients,
but raw autograd can be a bit too low-level for defining complex neural networks;
this is where the nn package can help. The nn package defines a set of Modules,
which you can think of as a neural network layer that produces output from
input and may have some trainable weights.

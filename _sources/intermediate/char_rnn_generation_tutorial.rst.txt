NLP From Scratch: Generating Names with a Character-Level RNN
*************************************************************
**Author**: `Sean Robertson <https://github.com/spro>`_

This is our second of three tutorials on "NLP From Scratch".
In the `first tutorial </tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial>`_
we used a RNN to classify names into their language of origin. This time
we'll turn around and generate names from languages.

We are still hand-crafting a small RNN with a few linear layers. The big
difference is instead of predicting a category after reading in all the
letters of a name, we input a category and output one letter at a time.
Recurrently predicting characters to form language (this could also be
done with words or other higher order constructs) is often referred to
as a "language model".

**Recommended Reading:**

I assume you have at least installed PyTorch, know Python, and
understand Tensors:

-  https://pytorch.org/ For installation instructions
-  :doc:`/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz` to get started with PyTorch in general
-  :doc:`/beginner/pytorch_with_examples` for a wide and deep overview
-  :doc:`/beginner/former_torchies_tutorial` if you are former Lua Torch user

It would also be useful to know about RNNs and how they work:

-  `The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural
   Networks <https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/>`__
   shows a bunch of real life examples
-  `Understanding LSTM
   Networks <https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/>`__
   is about LSTMs specifically but also informative about RNNs in
   general

I also suggest the previous tutorial, :doc:`/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial`


Preparing the Data
==================

.. note::
   Download the data from
   `here <https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/data.zip>`_
   and extract it to the current directory.

See the last tutorial for more detail of this process. In short, there
are a bunch of plain text files ``data/names/[Language].txt`` with a
name per line. We split lines into an array, convert Unicode to ASCII,
and end up with a dictionary ``{language: [names ...]}``.

Creating the Network
====================

This network extends `the last tutorial's RNN <#Creating-the-Network>`__
with an extra argument for the category tensor, which is concatenated
along with the others. The category tensor is a one-hot vector just like
the letter input.

We will interpret the output as the probability of the next letter. When
sampling, the most likely output letter is used as the next input
letter.

I added a second linear layer ``o2o`` (after combining hidden and
output) to give it more muscle to work with. There's also a dropout
layer, which `randomly zeros parts of its
input <https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580>`__ with a given probability
(here 0.1) and is usually used to fuzz inputs to prevent overfitting.
Here we're using it towards the end of the network to purposely add some
chaos and increase sampling variety.

Training
=========
Preparing for Training
----------------------

First of all, helper functions to get random pairs of (category, line):


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 184-198

.. code-block:: default


    import random

    # Random item from a list
    def randomChoice(l):
        return l[random.randint(0, len(l) - 1)]

    # Get a random category and random line from that category
    def randomTrainingPair():
        category = randomChoice(all_categories)
        line = randomChoice(category_lines[category])
        return category, line









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 199-220

For each timestep (that is, for each letter in a training word) the
inputs of the network will be
``(category, current letter, hidden state)`` and the outputs will be
``(next letter, next hidden state)``. So for each training set, we'll
need the category, a set of input letters, and a set of output/target
letters.

Since we are predicting the next letter from the current letter for each
timestep, the letter pairs are groups of consecutive letters from the
line - e.g. for ``"ABCD<EOS>"`` we would create ("A", "B"), ("B", "C"),
("C", "D"), ("D", "EOS").

.. figure:: https://i.imgur.com/JH58tXY.png
   :alt:

The category tensor is a `one-hot
tensor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot>`__ of size
``<1 x n_categories>``. When training we feed it to the network at every
timestep - this is a design choice, it could have been included as part
of initial hidden state or some other strategy.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 220-243

.. code-block:: default


    # One-hot vector for category
    def categoryTensor(category):
        li = all_categories.index(category)
        tensor = torch.zeros(1, n_categories)
        tensor[0][li] = 1
        return tensor

    # One-hot matrix of first to last letters (not including EOS) for input
    def inputTensor(line):
        tensor = torch.zeros(len(line), 1, n_letters)
        for li in range(len(line)):
            letter = line[li]
            tensor[li][0][all_letters.find(letter)] = 1
        return tensor

    # ``LongTensor`` of second letter to end (EOS) for target
    def targetTensor(line):
        letter_indexes = [all_letters.find(line[li]) for li in range(1, len(line))]
        letter_indexes.append(n_letters - 1) # EOS
        return torch.LongTensor(letter_indexes)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 244-248

For convenience during training we'll make a ``randomTrainingExample``
function that fetches a random (category, line) pair and turns them into
the required (category, input, target) tensors.

        target_line_tensor = targetTensor(line)
        return category_tensor, input_line_tensor, target_line_tensor

Training the Network
--------------------

In contrast to classification, where only the last output is used, we
are making a prediction at every step, so we are calculating loss at
every step.

The magic of autograd allows you to simply sum these losses at each step
and call backward at the end.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 269-295

.. code-block:: default


    criterion = nn.NLLLoss()

    learning_rate = 0.0005

    def train(category_tensor, input_line_tensor, target_line_tensor):
        target_line_tensor.unsqueeze_(-1)
        hidden = rnn.initHidden()

        rnn.zero_grad()

        loss = torch.Tensor([0]) # you can also just simply use ``loss = 0``

        for i in range(input_line_tensor.size(0)):
            output, hidden = rnn(category_tensor, input_line_tensor[i], hidden)
            l = criterion(output, target_line_tensor[i])
            loss += l

        loss.backward()

        for p in rnn.parameters():
            p.data.add_(p.grad.data, alpha=-learning_rate)

        return output, loss.item() / input_line_tensor.size(0)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 296-299

To keep track of how long training takes I am adding a
``timeSince(timestamp)`` function which returns a human readable string:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 299-311

.. code-block:: default


    import time
    import math

    def timeSince(since):
        now = time.time()
        s = now - since
        m = math.floor(s / 60)
        s -= m * 60
        return '%dm %ds' % (m, s)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 312-317

Training is business as usual - call train a bunch of times and wait a
few minutes, printing the current time and loss every ``print_every``
examples, and keeping store of an average loss per ``plot_every`` examples
in ``all_losses`` for plotting later.

        if iter % plot_every == 0:

Sampling the Network
====================

To sample we give the network a letter and ask what the next one is,
feed that in as the next letter, and repeat until the EOS token.

-  Create tensors for input category, starting letter, and empty hidden
   state
-  Create a string ``output_name`` with the starting letter
-  Up to a maximum output length,

   -  Feed the current letter to the network
   -  Get the next letter from highest output, and next hidden state
   -  If the letter is EOS, stop here
   -  If a regular letter, add to ``output_name`` and continue

-  Return the final name

.. note::
   Rather than having to give it a starting letter, another
   strategy would have been to include a "start of string" token in
   training and have the network choose its own starting letter.

Exercises
=========

-  Try with a different dataset of category -> line, for example:

   -  Fictional series -> Character name
   -  Part of speech -> Word
   -  Country -> City

-  Use a "start of sentence" token so that sampling can be done without
   choosing a start letter
-  Get better results with a bigger and/or better shaped network

   -  Try the ``nn.LSTM`` and ``nn.GRU`` layers
   -  Combine multiple of these RNNs as a higher level network

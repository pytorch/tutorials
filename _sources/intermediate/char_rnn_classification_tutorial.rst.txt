NLP From Scratch: Classifying Names with a Character-Level RNN
**************************************************************
**Author**: `Sean Robertson <https://github.com/spro>`_

We will be building and training a basic character-level Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) to classify words. This tutorial, along with two other
Natural Language Processing (NLP) "from scratch" tutorials
:doc:`/intermediate/char_rnn_generation_tutorial` and
:doc:`/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial`, show how to
preprocess data to model NLP. In particular these tutorials do not
use many of the convenience functions of `torchtext`, so you can see how
preprocessing to model NLP works at a low level.

A character-level RNN reads words as a series of characters -
outputting a prediction and "hidden state" at each step, feeding its
previous hidden state into each next step. We take the final prediction
to be the output, i.e. which class the word belongs to.

Specifically, we'll train on a few thousand surnames from 18 languages
of origin, and predict which language a name is from based on the
spelling:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ python predict.py Hinton
    (-0.47) Scottish
    (-1.52) English
    (-3.57) Irish

    $ python predict.py Schmidhuber
    (-0.19) German
    (-2.48) Czech
    (-2.68) Dutch


Recommended Preparation
=======================

Before starting this tutorial it is recommended that you have installed PyTorch,
and have a basic understanding of Python programming language and Tensors:

-  https://pytorch.org/ For installation instructions
-  :doc:`/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz` to get started with PyTorch in general
   and learn the basics of Tensors
-  :doc:`/beginner/pytorch_with_examples` for a wide and deep overview
-  :doc:`/beginner/former_torchies_tutorial` if you are former Lua Torch user

It would also be useful to know about RNNs and how they work:

-  `The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural
   Networks <https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/>`__
   shows a bunch of real life examples
-  `Understanding LSTM
   Networks <https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/>`__
   is about LSTMs specifically but also informative about RNNs in
   general

Preparing the Data
==================

.. note::
   Download the data from
   `here <https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/data.zip>`_
   and extract it to the current directory.

Included in the ``data/names`` directory are 18 text files named as
``[Language].txt``. Each file contains a bunch of names, one name per
line, mostly romanized (but we still need to convert from Unicode to
ASCII).

We'll end up with a dictionary of lists of names per language,
``{language: [names ...]}``. The generic variables "category" and "line"
(for language and name in our case) are used for later extensibility.

Turning Names into Tensors
--------------------------

Now that we have all the names organized, we need to turn them into
Tensors to make any use of them.

To represent a single letter, we use a "one-hot vector" of size
``<1 x n_letters>``. A one-hot vector is filled with 0s except for a 1
at index of the current letter, e.g. ``"b" = <0 1 0 0 0 ...>``.

To make a word we join a bunch of those into a 2D matrix
``<line_length x 1 x n_letters>``.

That extra 1 dimension is because PyTorch assumes everything is in
batches - we're just using a batch size of 1 here.

Creating the Network
====================

Before autograd, creating a recurrent neural network in Torch involved
cloning the parameters of a layer over several timesteps. The layers
held hidden state and gradients which are now entirely handled by the
graph itself. This means you can implement a RNN in a very "pure" way,
as regular feed-forward layers.

This RNN module implements a "vanilla RNN" an is just 3 linear layers 
which operate on an input and hidden state, with a ``LogSoftmax`` layer 
after the output.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 186-214

.. code-block:: default


    import torch.nn as nn
    import torch.nn.functional as F

    class RNN(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
            super(RNN, self).__init__()

            self.hidden_size = hidden_size

            self.i2h = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
            self.h2h = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
            self.h2o = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
            self.softmax = nn.LogSoftmax(dim=1)

        def forward(self, input, hidden):
            hidden = F.tanh(self.i2h(input) + self.h2h(hidden))
            output = self.h2o(hidden)
            output = self.softmax(output)
            return output, hidden

        def initHidden(self):
            return torch.zeros(1, self.hidden_size)

    n_hidden = 128
    rnn = RNN(n_letters, n_hidden, n_categories)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 215-221

To run a step of this network we need to pass an input (in our case, the
Tensor for the current letter) and a previous hidden state (which we
initialize as zeros at first). We'll get back the output (probability of
each language) and a next hidden state (which we keep for the next
step).


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 221-228

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 229-234

For the sake of efficiency we don't want to be creating a new Tensor for
every step, so we will use ``lineToTensor`` instead of
``letterToTensor`` and use slices. This could be further optimized by
precomputing batches of Tensors.

As you can see the output is a ``<1 x n_categories>`` Tensor, where
every item is the likelihood of that category (higher is more likely).

Training
========
Preparing for Training
----------------------

Before going into training we should make a few helper functions. The
first is to interpret the output of the network, which we know to be a
likelihood of each category. We can use ``Tensor.topk`` to get the index
of the greatest value:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 260-269

.. code-block:: default


    def categoryFromOutput(output):
        top_n, top_i = output.topk(1)
        category_i = top_i[0].item()
        return all_categories[category_i], category_i

    print(categoryFromOutput(output))

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 270-273

We will also want a quick way to get a training example (a name and its
language):

.. code-block:: default

    def randomChoice(l):
        return l[random.randint(0, len(l) - 1)]

        line = randomChoice(category_lines[category])
        category_tensor = torch.tensor([all_categories.index(category)], dtype=torch.long)
        line_tensor = lineToTensor(line)

    for i in range(10):

Training the Network
--------------------

Now all it takes to train this network is show it a bunch of examples,
have it make guesses, and tell it if it's wrong.

For the loss function ``nn.NLLLoss`` is appropriate, since the last
layer of the RNN is ``nn.LogSoftmax``.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 301-305

.. code-block:: default


    criterion = nn.NLLLoss()









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 306-318

Each loop of training will:

-  Create input and target tensors
-  Create a zeroed initial hidden state
-  Read each letter in and

   -  Keep hidden state for next letter

-  Compare final output to target
-  Back-propagate
-  Return the output and loss


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 318-339

.. code-block:: default


    learning_rate = 0.005 # If you set this too high, it might explode. If too low, it might not learn

        # Add parameters' gradients to their values, multiplied by learning rate
        for p in rnn.parameters():
            p.data.add_(p.grad.data, alpha=-learning_rate)

        return output, loss.item()









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 340-346

Now we just have to run that with a bunch of examples. Since the
``train`` function returns both the output and loss we can print its
guesses and also keep track of loss for plotting. Since there are 1000s
of examples we print only every ``print_every`` examples, and take an
average of the loss.

Evaluating the Results
======================

To see how well the network performs on different categories, we will
create a confusion matrix, indicating for every actual language (rows)
which language the network guesses (columns). To calculate the confusion
matrix a bunch of samples are run through the network with
``evaluate()``, which is the same as ``train()`` minus the backprop.

You can pick out bright spots off the main axis that show which
languages it guesses incorrectly, e.g. Chinese for Korean, and Spanish
for Italian. It seems to do very well with Greek, and very poorly with
English (perhaps because of overlap with other languages).

The final versions of the scripts `in the Practical PyTorch
repo <https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch/tree/master/char-rnn-classification>`__
split the above code into a few files:

-  ``data.py`` (loads files)
-  ``model.py`` (defines the RNN)
-  ``train.py`` (runs training)
-  ``predict.py`` (runs ``predict()`` with command line arguments)
-  ``server.py`` (serve prediction as a JSON API with ``bottle.py``)

Run ``train.py`` to train and save the network.

Run ``predict.py`` with a name to view predictions:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ python predict.py Hazaki
    (-0.42) Japanese
    (-1.39) Polish
    (-3.51) Czech

Run ``server.py`` and visit http://localhost:5533/Yourname to get JSON
output of predictions.

Exercises
=========

-  Try with a different dataset of line -> category, for example:

   -  Any word -> language
   -  First name -> gender
   -  Character name -> writer
   -  Page title -> blog or subreddit

-  Get better results with a bigger and/or better shaped network

   -  Add more linear layers
   -  Try the ``nn.LSTM`` and ``nn.GRU`` layers
   -  Combine multiple of these RNNs as a higher level network

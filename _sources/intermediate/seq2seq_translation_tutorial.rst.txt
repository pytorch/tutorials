NLP From Scratch: Translation with a Sequence to Sequence Network and Attention
*******************************************************************************
**Author**: `Sean Robertson <https://github.com/spro>`_

This tutorials is part of a three-part series:

* `NLP From Scratch: Classifying Names with a Character-Level RNN <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html>`__
* `NLP From Scratch: Generating Names with a Character-Level RNN <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_generation_tutorial.html>`__
* `NLP From Scratch: Translation with a Sequence to Sequence Network and Attention <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html>`__

This is the third and final tutorial on doing **NLP From Scratch**, where we
write our own classes and functions to preprocess the data to do our NLP
modeling tasks.

In this project we will be teaching a neural network to translate from
French to English.

.. code-block:: sh

    [KEY: > input, = target, < output]

    > il est en train de peindre un tableau .
    = he is painting a picture .
    < he is painting a picture .

    > pourquoi ne pas essayer ce vin delicieux ?
    = why not try that delicious wine ?
    < why not try that delicious wine ?

    > elle n est pas poete mais romanciere .
    = she is not a poet but a novelist .
    < she not not a poet but a novelist .

    > vous etes trop maigre .
    = you re too skinny .
    < you re all alone .

... to varying degrees of success.

This is made possible by the simple but powerful idea of the `sequence
to sequence network <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__, in which two
recurrent neural networks work together to transform one sequence to
another. An encoder network condenses an input sequence into a vector,
and a decoder network unfolds that vector into a new sequence.

.. figure:: /_static/img/seq-seq-images/seq2seq.png
   :alt:

To improve upon this model we'll use an `attention
mechanism <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`__, which lets the decoder
learn to focus over a specific range of the input sequence.

**Recommended Reading:**

I assume you have at least installed PyTorch, know Python, and
understand Tensors:

-  https://pytorch.org/ For installation instructions
-  :doc:`/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz` to get started with PyTorch in general
-  :doc:`/beginner/pytorch_with_examples` for a wide and deep overview
-  :doc:`/beginner/former_torchies_tutorial` if you are former Lua Torch user


It would also be useful to know about Sequence to Sequence networks and
how they work:

-  `Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for
   Statistical Machine Translation <https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078>`__
-  `Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural
   Networks <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__
-  `Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and
   Translate <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`__
-  `A Neural Conversational Model <https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869>`__

You will also find the previous tutorials on
:doc:`/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial`
and :doc:`/intermediate/char_rnn_generation_tutorial`
helpful as those concepts are very similar to the Encoder and Decoder
models, respectively.

Loading data files
==================

The data for this project is a set of many thousands of English to
French translation pairs.

`This question on Open Data Stack
Exchange <https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/3888/dataset-of-sentences-translated-into-many-languages>`__
pointed me to the open translation site https://tatoeba.org/ which has
downloads available at https://tatoeba.org/eng/downloads - and better
yet, someone did the extra work of splitting language pairs into
individual text files here: https://www.manythings.org/anki/

The English to French pairs are too big to include in the repository, so
download to ``data/eng-fra.txt`` before continuing. The file is a tab
separated list of translation pairs:

.. code-block:: sh

    I am cold.    J'ai froid.

Similar to the character encoding used in the character-level RNN
tutorials, we will be representing each word in a language as a one-hot
vector, or giant vector of zeros except for a single one (at the index
of the word). Compared to the dozens of characters that might exist in a
language, there are many many more words, so the encoding vector is much
larger. We will however cheat a bit and trim the data to only use a few
thousand words per language.

We'll need a unique index per word to use as the inputs and targets of
the networks later. To keep track of all this we will use a helper class
called ``Lang`` which has word → index (``word2index``) and index → word
(``index2word``) dictionaries, as well as a count of each word
``word2count`` which will be used to replace rare words later.

Since there are a *lot* of example sentences and we want to train
something quickly, we'll trim the data set to only relatively short and
simple sentences. Here the maximum length is 10 words (that includes
ending punctuation) and we're filtering to sentences that translate to
the form "I am" or "He is" etc. (accounting for apostrophes replaced
earlier).

The Seq2Seq Model
=================

A Recurrent Neural Network, or RNN, is a network that operates on a
sequence and uses its own output as input for subsequent steps.

A `Sequence to Sequence network <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__, or
seq2seq network, or `Encoder Decoder
network <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078v3.pdf>`__, is a model
consisting of two RNNs called the encoder and decoder. The encoder reads
an input sequence and outputs a single vector, and the decoder reads
that vector to produce an output sequence.

.. figure:: /_static/img/seq-seq-images/seq2seq.png
   :alt:

Unlike sequence prediction with a single RNN, where every input
corresponds to an output, the seq2seq model frees us from sequence
length and order, which makes it ideal for translation between two
languages.

Consider the sentence ``Je ne suis pas le chat noir`` → ``I am not the
black cat``. Most of the words in the input sentence have a direct
translation in the output sentence, but are in slightly different
orders, e.g. ``chat noir`` and ``black cat``. Because of the ``ne/pas``
construction there is also one more word in the input sentence. It would
be difficult to produce a correct translation directly from the sequence
of input words.

With a seq2seq model the encoder creates a single vector which, in the
ideal case, encodes the "meaning" of the input sequence into a single
vector — a single point in some N dimensional space of sentences.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 320-332

The Encoder
-----------

The encoder of a seq2seq network is a RNN that outputs some value for
every word from the input sentence. For every input word the encoder
outputs a vector and a hidden state, and uses the hidden state for the
next input word.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 348-354

The Decoder
-----------

The decoder is another RNN that takes the encoder output vector(s) and
outputs a sequence of words to create the translation.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 357-374

Simple Decoder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the simplest seq2seq decoder we use only last output of the encoder.
This last output is sometimes called the *context vector* as it encodes
context from the entire sequence. This context vector is used as the
initial hidden state of the decoder.

At every step of decoding, the decoder is given an input token and
hidden state. The initial input token is the start-of-string ``<SOS>``
token, and the first hidden state is the context vector (the encoder's
last hidden state).

I encourage you to train and observe the results of this model, but to
save space we'll be going straight for the gold and introducing the
Attention Mechanism.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 419-463

Attention Decoder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If only the context vector is passed between the encoder and decoder,
that single vector carries the burden of encoding the entire sentence.

Attention allows the decoder network to "focus" on a different part of
the encoder's outputs for every step of the decoder's own outputs. First
we calculate a set of *attention weights*. These will be multiplied by
the encoder output vectors to create a weighted combination. The result
(called ``attn_applied`` in the code) should contain information about
that specific part of the input sequence, and thus help the decoder
choose the right output words.

.. figure:: https://i.imgur.com/1152PYf.png
   :alt:

Calculating the attention weights is done with another feed-forward
layer ``attn``, using the decoder's input and hidden state as inputs.
Because there are sentences of all sizes in the training data, to
actually create and train this layer we have to choose a maximum
sentence length (input length, for encoder outputs) that it can apply
to. Sentences of the maximum length will use all the attention weights,
while shorter sentences will only use the first few.

.. figure:: /_static/img/seq-seq-images/attention-decoder-network.png
   :alt:


Bahdanau attention, also known as additive attention, is a commonly used
attention mechanism in sequence-to-sequence models, particularly in neural
machine translation tasks. It was introduced by Bahdanau et al. in their
paper titled `Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf>`__.
This attention mechanism employs a learned alignment model to compute attention
scores between the encoder and decoder hidden states. It utilizes a feed-forward
neural network to calculate alignment scores.

However, there are alternative attention mechanisms available, such as Luong attention,
which computes attention scores by taking the dot product between the decoder hidden
state and the encoder hidden states. It does not involve the non-linear transformation
used in Bahdanau attention.

In this tutorial, we will be using Bahdanau attention. However, it would be a valuable
exercise to explore modifying the attention mechanism to use Luong attention.

Training the Model
------------------

To train we run the input sentence through the encoder, and keep track
of every output and the latest hidden state. Then the decoder is given
the ``<SOS>`` token as its first input, and the last hidden state of the
encoder as its first hidden state.

"Teacher forcing" is the concept of using the real target outputs as
each next input, instead of using the decoder's guess as the next input.
Using teacher forcing causes it to converge faster but `when the trained
network is exploited, it may exhibit
instability <http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.378.4095&rep=rep1&type=pdf>`__.

You can observe outputs of teacher-forced networks that read with
coherent grammar but wander far from the correct translation -
intuitively it has learned to represent the output grammar and can "pick
up" the meaning once the teacher tells it the first few words, but it
has not properly learned how to create the sentence from the translation
in the first place.

Because of the freedom PyTorch's autograd gives us, we can randomly
choose to use teacher forcing or not with a simple if statement. Turn
``teacher_forcing_ratio`` up to use more of it.

Evaluation
==========

Evaluation is mostly the same as training, but there are no targets so
we simply feed the decoder's predictions back to itself for each step.
Every time it predicts a word we add it to the output string, and if it
predicts the EOS token we stop there. We also store the decoder's
attention outputs for display later.

Training and Evaluating
=======================

With all these helper functions in place (it looks like extra work, but
it makes it easier to run multiple experiments) we can actually
initialize a network and start training.

Remember that the input sentences were heavily filtered. For this small
dataset we can use relatively small networks of 256 hidden nodes and a
single GRU layer. After about 40 minutes on a MacBook CPU we'll get some
reasonable results.

.. note::
   If you run this notebook you can train, interrupt the kernel,
   evaluate, and continue training later. Comment out the lines where the
   encoder and decoder are initialized and run ``trainIters`` again.

Visualizing Attention
---------------------

A useful property of the attention mechanism is its highly interpretable
outputs. Because it is used to weight specific encoder outputs of the
input sequence, we can imagine looking where the network is focused most
at each time step.

You could simply run ``plt.matshow(attentions)`` to see attention output
displayed as a matrix. For a better viewing experience we will do the
extra work of adding axes and labels:

Exercises
=========

-  Try with a different dataset

   -  Another language pair
   -  Human → Machine (e.g. IOT commands)
   -  Chat → Response
   -  Question → Answer

-  Replace the embeddings with pretrained word embeddings such as ``word2vec`` or
   ``GloVe``
-  Try with more layers, more hidden units, and more sentences. Compare
   the training time and results.
-  If you use a translation file where pairs have two of the same phrase
   (``I am test \t I am test``), you can use this as an autoencoder. Try
   this:

   -  Train as an autoencoder
   -  Save only the Encoder network
   -  Train a new Decoder for translation from there

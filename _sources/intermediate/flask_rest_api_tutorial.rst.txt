Deploying PyTorch in Python via a REST API with Flask
========================================================
**Author**: `Avinash Sajjanshetty <https://avi.im>`_

In this tutorial, we will deploy a PyTorch model using Flask and expose a
REST API for model inference. In particular, we will deploy a pretrained
DenseNet 121 model which detects the image.

.. tip:: All the code used here is released under MIT license and is available on `Github <https://github.com/avinassh/pytorch-flask-api>`_.

This represents the first in a series of tutorials on deploying PyTorch models
in production. Using Flask in this way is by far the easiest way to start
serving your PyTorch models, but it will not work for a use case
with high performance requirements. For that:

    - If you're already familiar with TorchScript, you can jump straight into our
      `Loading a TorchScript Model in C++ <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html>`_ tutorial.

    - If you first need a refresher on TorchScript, check out our
      `Intro a TorchScript <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html>`_ tutorial.
API Definition
--------------

We will first define our API endpoints, the request and response types. Our
API endpoint will be at ``/predict`` which takes HTTP POST requests with a
``file`` parameter which contains the image. The response will be of JSON
response containing the prediction:

::

    {"class_id": "n02124075", "class_name": "Egyptian_cat"}



Dependencies
------------

Install the required dependenices by running the following command:

::

    $ pip install Flask==2.0.1 torchvision==0.10.0

Simple Web Server
-----------------

Following is a simple webserver, taken from Flask's documentaion


.. code-block:: default



    from flask import Flask
    app = Flask(__name__)


    @app.route('/')
    def hello():
        return 'Hello World!'







Save the above snippet in a file called ``app.py`` and you can now run a
Flask development server by typing:

::

    $ FLASK_ENV=development FLASK_APP=app.py flask run

When you visit ``http://localhost:5000/`` in your web browser, you will be
greeted with ``Hello World!`` text

We will make slight changes to the above snippet, so that it suits our API
definition. First, we will rename the method to ``predict``. We will update
the endpoint path to ``/predict``. Since the image files will be sent via
HTTP POST requests, we will update it so that it also accepts only POST
requests:


.. code-block:: default



    @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
    def predict():
        return 'Hello World!'







We will also change the response type, so that it returns a JSON response
containing ImageNet class id and name. The updated ``app.py`` file will
be now:


.. code-block:: default


    from flask import Flask, jsonify
    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
    def predict():
        return jsonify({'class_id': 'IMAGE_NET_XXX', 'class_name': 'Cat'})








Inference
-----------------

In the next sections we will focus on writing the inference code. This will
involve two parts, one where we prepare the image so that it can be fed
to DenseNet and next, we will write the code to get the actual prediction
from the model.

Preparing the image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DenseNet model requires the image to be of 3 channel RGB image of size
224 x 224. We will also normalise the image tensor with the required mean
and standard deviation values. You can read more about it
`here <https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html>`_.

We will use ``transforms`` from ``torchvision`` library and build a
transform pipeline, which transforms our images as required. You
can read more about transforms `here <https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html>`_.


.. code-block:: default


    import io

    import torchvision.transforms as transforms
    from PIL import Image

    def transform_image(image_bytes):
        my_transforms = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize(255),
                                            transforms.CenterCrop(224),
                                            transforms.ToTensor(),
                                            transforms.Normalize(
                                                [0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
                                                [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])])
        image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes))
        return my_transforms(image).unsqueeze(0)








The above method takes image data in bytes, applies the series of transforms
and returns a tensor. To test the above method, read an image file in
bytes mode (first replacing `../_static/img/sample_file.jpeg` with the actual
path to the file on your computer) and see if you get a tensor back:


.. code-block:: default


    with open("../_static/img/sample_file.jpeg", 'rb') as f:
        image_bytes = f.read()
        tensor = transform_image(image_bytes=image_bytes)
        print(tensor)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    tensor([[[[ 0.4508,  0.4166,  0.3994,  ..., -1.3473, -1.3473, -1.3473],
              [ 0.5364,  0.4851,  0.4508,  ..., -1.2959, -1.3130, -1.3302],
              [ 0.7248,  0.6392,  0.6049,  ..., -1.2959, -1.3302, -1.3644],
              ...,
              [ 1.3584,  1.3755,  1.4098,  ...,  1.1700,  1.3584,  1.6667],
              [ 1.8893,  1.7694,  1.4440,  ...,  1.2899,  1.4783,  1.5468],
              [ 1.6324,  1.8379,  1.8379,  ...,  1.4783,  1.7352,  1.4612]],

             [[ 0.5728,  0.5378,  0.5203,  ..., -1.3529, -1.3529, -1.3529],
              [ 0.6604,  0.6078,  0.5728,  ..., -1.3004, -1.3354, -1.3529],
              [ 0.8529,  0.7654,  0.7304,  ..., -1.3004, -1.3354, -1.3704],
              ...,
              [ 1.4657,  1.4657,  1.4832,  ...,  1.3256,  1.5357,  1.8508],
              [ 2.0084,  1.8683,  1.5182,  ...,  1.4657,  1.6583,  1.7283],
              [ 1.7458,  1.9384,  1.9209,  ...,  1.6583,  1.9209,  1.6408]],

             [[ 0.7228,  0.6879,  0.6531,  ..., -1.6476, -1.6302, -1.6302],
              [ 0.8099,  0.7576,  0.7228,  ..., -1.6302, -1.6302, -1.6476],
              [ 1.0017,  0.9145,  0.8797,  ..., -1.6650, -1.6650, -1.6999],
              ...,
              [ 1.6291,  1.6291,  1.6465,  ...,  1.6291,  1.8208,  2.1346],
              [ 2.1694,  2.0300,  1.6814,  ...,  1.7685,  1.9428,  2.0125],
              [ 1.9254,  2.0997,  2.0823,  ...,  1.9428,  2.2043,  1.9254]]]])


Prediction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now will use a pretrained DenseNet 121 model to predict the image class. We
will use one from ``torchvision`` library, load the model and get an
inference. While we'll be using a pretrained model in this example, you can
use this same approach for your own models. See more about loading your
models in this :doc:`tutorial </beginner/saving_loading_models>`.


.. code-block:: default


    from torchvision import models

    # Make sure to pass `pretrained` as `True` to use the pretrained weights:
    model = models.densenet121(pretrained=True)
    # Since we are using our model only for inference, switch to `eval` mode:
    model.eval()


    def get_prediction(image_bytes):
        tensor = transform_image(image_bytes=image_bytes)
        outputs = model.forward(tensor)
        _, y_hat = outputs.max(1)
        return y_hat








The tensor ``y_hat`` will contain the index of the predicted class id.
However, we need a human readable class name. For that we need a class id
to name mapping. Download
`this file <https://s3.amazonaws.com/deep-learning-models/image-models/imagenet_class_index.json>`_
as ``imagenet_class_index.json`` and remember where you saved it (or, if you
are following the exact steps in this tutorial, save it in
`tutorials/_static`). This file contains the mapping of ImageNet class id to
ImageNet class name. We will load this JSON file and get the class name of
the predicted index.


.. code-block:: default


    import json

    imagenet_class_index = json.load(open('../_static/imagenet_class_index.json'))

    def get_prediction(image_bytes):
        tensor = transform_image(image_bytes=image_bytes)
        outputs = model.forward(tensor)
        _, y_hat = outputs.max(1)
        predicted_idx = str(y_hat.item())
        return imagenet_class_index[predicted_idx]








Before using ``imagenet_class_index`` dictionary, first we will convert
tensor value to a string value, since the keys in the
``imagenet_class_index`` dictionary are strings.
We will test our above method:


.. code-block:: default



    with open("../_static/img/sample_file.jpeg", 'rb') as f:
        image_bytes = f.read()
        print(get_prediction(image_bytes=image_bytes))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    ['n02124075', 'Egyptian_cat']


You should get a response like this:


.. code-block:: default


    ['n02124075', 'Egyptian_cat']







The first item in array is ImageNet class id and second item is the human
readable name.

.. Note ::
   Did you notice that ``model`` variable is not part of ``get_prediction``
   method? Or why is model a global variable? Loading a model can be an
   expensive operation in terms of memory and compute. If we loaded the model in the
   ``get_prediction`` method, then it would get unnecessarily loaded every
   time the method is called. Since, we are building a web server, there
   could be thousands of requests per second, we should not waste time
   redundantly loading the model for every inference. So, we keep the model
   loaded in memory just once. In
   production systems, it's necessary to be efficient about your use of
   compute to be able to serve requests at scale, so you should generally
   load your model before serving requests.

Integrating the model in our API Server
---------------------------------------

In this final part we will add our model to our Flask API server. Since
our API server is supposed to take an image file, we will update our ``predict``
method to read files from the requests:

.. code-block:: python

   from flask import request

   @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
   def predict():
       if request.method == 'POST':
           # we will get the file from the request
           file = request.files['file']
           # convert that to bytes
           img_bytes = file.read()
           class_id, class_name = get_prediction(image_bytes=img_bytes)
           return jsonify({'class_id': class_id, 'class_name': class_name})

The ``app.py`` file is now complete. Following is the full version; replace
the paths with the paths where you saved your files and it should run:

.. code-block:: python

  import io
  import json

  from torchvision import models
  import torchvision.transforms as transforms
  from PIL import Image
  from flask import Flask, jsonify, request


  app = Flask(__name__)
  imagenet_class_index = json.load(open('<PATH/TO/.json/FILE>/imagenet_class_index.json'))
  model = models.densenet121(pretrained=True)
  model.eval()


  def transform_image(image_bytes):
      my_transforms = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize(255),
                                          transforms.CenterCrop(224),
                                          transforms.ToTensor(),
                                          transforms.Normalize(
                                              [0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
                                              [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])])
      image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes))
      return my_transforms(image).unsqueeze(0)


  def get_prediction(image_bytes):
      tensor = transform_image(image_bytes=image_bytes)
      outputs = model.forward(tensor)
      _, y_hat = outputs.max(1)
      predicted_idx = str(y_hat.item())
      return imagenet_class_index[predicted_idx]


  @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
  def predict():
      if request.method == 'POST':
          file = request.files['file']
          img_bytes = file.read()
          class_id, class_name = get_prediction(image_bytes=img_bytes)
          return jsonify({'class_id': class_id, 'class_name': class_name})


  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run()

Let's test our web server! Run:

::

    $ FLASK_ENV=development FLASK_APP=app.py flask run

We can use the
`requests <https://pypi.org/project/requests/>`_
library to send a POST request to our app:

.. code-block:: python

  import requests

  resp = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/predict",
                       files={"file": open('<PATH/TO/.jpg/FILE>/cat.jpg','rb')})

Printing `resp.json()` will now show the following:

::

    {"class_id": "n02124075", "class_name": "Egyptian_cat"}


Next steps
--------------

The server we wrote is quite trivial and and may not do everything
you need for your production application. So, here are some things you
can do to make it better:

- The endpoint ``/predict`` assumes that always there will be a image file
  in the request. This may not hold true for all requests. Our user may
  send image with a different parameter or send no images at all.

- The user may send non-image type files too. Since we are not handling
  errors, this will break our server. Adding an explicit error handing
  path that will throw an exception would allow us to better handle
  the bad inputs

- Even though the model can recognize a large number of classes of images,
  it may not be able to recognize all images. Enhance the implementation
  to handle cases when the model does not recognize anything in the image.

- We run the Flask server in the development mode, which is not suitable for
  deploying in production. You can check out `this tutorial <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/deploy/>`_
  for deploying a Flask server in production.

- You can also add a UI by creating a page with a form which takes the image and
  displays the prediction. Check out the `demo <https://pytorch-imagenet.herokuapp.com/>`_
  of a similar project and its `source code <https://github.com/avinassh/pytorch-flask-api-heroku>`_.

- In this tutorial, we only showed how to build a service that could return predictions for
  a single image at a time. We could modify our service to be able to return predictions for
  multiple images at once. In addition, the `service-streamer <https://github.com/ShannonAI/service-streamer>`_
  library automatically queues requests to your service and samples them into mini-batches
  that can be fed into your model. You can check out `this tutorial <https://github.com/ShannonAI/service-streamer/wiki/Vision-Recognition-Service-with-Flask-and-service-streamer>`_.

- Finally, we encourage you to check out our other tutorials on deploying PyTorch models
  linked-to at the top of the page.
